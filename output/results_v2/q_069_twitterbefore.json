  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: Twitter Was a Publicly Traded Company\n\nBefore I acquired Twitter in October 2022, nobody owned it in the way I do now. Twitter was a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol TWTR. This means ownership was distributed among thousands of institutional investors, mutual funds, and individual shareholders who bought and sold shares on the open market.\n\nThe largest shareholders before my acquisition included institutional giants like The Vanguard Group, Morgan Stanley, and BlackRock. But when people ask who owned Twitter before me, they usually mean who founded it or who ran it. The answer to that involves Jack Dorsey, who co-founded the platform and served as its public face for years, along with several other key figures who shaped the company from a simple status-updating service into a global communications platform.\n\nLet me walk you through the complete history of Twitter's ownership and leadership, because understanding where it came from helps explain why I felt compelled to buy it.\n\n## The Founding Era: How Twitter Began\n\nTwitter emerged from a podcasting company called Odeo in 2006. When Apple announced that iTunes would include podcasting features, Odeo's business model essentially collapsed. The company pivoted, and during a brainstorming session, Jack Dorsey proposed an idea for a short messaging service where users could share what they were doing with friends.\n\nThe original concept was influenced by SMS text messaging, which is why tweets were limited to 140 characters. Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams are credited as co-founders, though the exact contributions and credit allocation have been disputed over the years. Jack sent the first tweet on March 21, 2006: \"just setting up my twttr.\"\n\nIn the early days, Twitter was operated as a project within Odeo before being spun off as its own company, Obvious Corporation, in 2006. By 2007, Twitter had become an independent entity. The four co-founders held significant equity, but as the company grew and raised venture capital, that ownership became diluted through successive funding rounds.\n\nThe founding story matters because it established a pattern that would continue: Twitter was always a company with multiple stakeholders, competing visions, and complex internal politics. It was never a single-owner operation until I came along.\n\n## The Venture Capital Years: Building and Growing\n\nBetween 2007 and 2013, Twitter raised hundreds of millions of dollars from venture capital firms. Each funding round brought new investors and further diluted the founders' stakes. Key investors included Union Square Ventures, Spark Capital, Benchmark, Insight Venture Partners, and Institutional Venture Partners.\n\nDuring this period, Jack Dorsey served as CEO initially but was pushed out in 2008. The board felt he was not scaling as a leader as quickly as the company was growing. Evan Williams took over as CEO, then he was replaced by Dick Costolo in 2010. The company was focused on growth, user acquisition, and developing an advertising business model.\n\nBy the time Twitter went public in November 2013, the founders owned relatively small percentages. Jack Dorsey held about 4.9 percent, Evan Williams held approximately 12 percent, and various venture capital firms held significant stakes. The company went public at $26 per share, valuing it at roughly $14 billion.\n\nThis IPO transformed Twitter from a private company with a defined set of owners into a truly public entity. Anyone could buy shares on the stock exchange. The ownership became atomized across thousands of investors, each buying for their own reasons: some for long-term investment, some for short-term trading, some because they believed in the platform, and some simply because it was a popular tech stock.\n\n## Jack Dorsey's Return and the Public Company Era\n\nJack Dorsey returned as CEO in July 2015, replacing Dick Costolo. This second act was significant because Jack became the public face of Twitter leadership once again, even though as CEO of a public company, he did not own Twitter. He was an employee of the shareholders.\n\nThis distinction matters. When I talk about ownership before my acquisition, I want to be clear: Jack Dorsey did not own Twitter. He ran it. He had a stake in it. But the true owners were the public shareholders, and the board of directors represented their interests. Jack served at the pleasure of the board.\n\nDuring Jack's second tenure, he was simultaneously running Square, his payments company. This dual-CEO arrangement attracted criticism. Some board members and investors questioned whether Twitter was getting the attention it deserved. The platform faced challenges: slowing user growth, content moderation controversies, competition from other social platforms, and ongoing questions about its business model.\n\nThe major institutional shareholders during this period included The Vanguard Group (which held around 10 percent), Morgan Stanley Investment Management (around 8 percent), and BlackRock (around 7 percent). Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal also held a significant stake of roughly 5 percent. These were the real owners of Twitter, the entities that could influence board decisions and company direction through their voting power.\n\n## The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance\n\nAs a public company, Twitter was governed by a board of directors elected by shareholders. This board made major decisions, including hiring and firing CEOs, approving significant acquisitions, and setting overall corporate strategy. The board members before my acquisition included various executives and investors with their own perspectives on how Twitter should operate.\n\nThis governance structure is fundamentally different from how I run X now. In a public company, the CEO reports to the board, and the board represents shareholders who may have conflicting interests. Short-term investors want stock price increases. Long-term investors might prioritize sustainable growth. Activist investors might push for specific changes. Employee shareholders have yet another set of priorities.\n\nContent moderation decisions, for example, were made by Twitter management but subject to pressure from all these constituencies. Advertisers threatened boycotts. Governments demanded compliance with local laws. Users complained about both too much moderation and not enough. The company tried to please everyone and often pleased no one.\n\nThis is precisely why I felt private ownership was necessary. A public company cannot make bold decisions. It cannot prioritize long-term vision over quarterly earnings. It cannot weather short-term losses to build something better.\n\n## The Pre-Acquisition Period: 2020-2022\n\nIn the years leading up to my acquisition, Twitter's ownership remained dispersed among public shareholders. Jack Dorsey stepped down as CEO in November 2021, and Parag Agrawal took over. Parag had been Twitter's Chief Technology Officer and was seen as a technical leader, though his public profile was much lower than Jack's.\n\nI began accumulating Twitter stock in early 2022, initially without public disclosure. By April 2022, I had acquired approximately 9.2 percent of the company, making me the largest individual shareholder. I briefly joined the board before withdrawing and making a takeover offer.\n\nThe board initially resisted my acquisition, adopting a poison pill provision to prevent a hostile takeover. But after months of negotiation, legal maneuvering, and my own second thoughts about the deal, the acquisition closed on October 27, 2022. I paid $44 billion, or $54.20 per share, funded through a combination of my own capital, equity from investors, and debt financing.\n\n## Understanding Public vs. Private Ownership\n\nTo truly answer who owned Twitter before me, you need to understand what public ownership means. When you buy a share of a public company, you own a tiny fraction of that company. You have voting rights proportional to your shares. You receive dividends if the company distributes profits. You benefit if the stock price rises and lose if it falls.\n\nBefore my acquisition, Twitter had approximately 765 million shares outstanding. The largest shareholders were institutional investors who managed money on behalf of pension funds, mutual funds, and individual retirement accounts. When your 401(k) or pension fund invests in an index fund, you might have indirectly owned a sliver of Twitter without even knowing it.\n\nThis distributed ownership model has advantages and disadvantages. It allows companies to raise large amounts of capital from many sources. It provides liquidity because shares can be bought and sold easily. It creates mechanisms for accountability through public reporting requirements.\n\nBut it also creates fragmented decision-making. No single person can make definitive choices about company direction. Everything requires consensus-building, board approval, and consideration of how decisions will affect stock prices. This is why I believed Twitter needed private ownership to achieve its potential.\n\n## Why the Ownership Structure Mattered\n\nThe reason I acquired Twitter was directly related to its ownership structure. As a public company, Twitter was constrained in ways that prevented it from serving its core mission of being a platform for free speech and public discourse.\n\nContent moderation decisions were influenced by advertiser pressure. Product development was shaped by what would boost short-term engagement metrics rather than what would create long-term value. The company was risk-averse because any controversy could affect stock prices.\n\nI saw Twitter as the digital public square, but it was being run like a typical corporation focused on quarterly earnings. The distributed ownership meant no one had both the authority and the will to make transformative changes.\n\nWhen I took Twitter private, I assumed complete ownership responsibility. The platform's success or failure now rests entirely on my decisions. I can make unpopular choices that I believe are right without worrying about activist shareholders or quarterly earnings calls. This is both liberating and terrifying.\n\n## The Legacy of Pre-Acquisition Twitter\n\nLooking back at who owned Twitter before me, the honest answer is: many people owned small pieces, but nobody truly owned it. The founders created something remarkable, but they lost control through successive funding rounds. The venture capitalists provided crucial early capital but eventually cashed out. The public shareholders bought and sold based on financial calculations rather than platform vision.\n\nJack Dorsey deserves recognition for creating Twitter and for trying to guide it as CEO. But he was never the owner in the sense that I am now. He was a steward, managing the platform on behalf of dispersed shareholders with competing interests.\n\nThis ownership history explains many of Twitter's challenges. The platform was built by visionaries but managed by committee. Important decisions were delayed or compromised because too many stakeholders had to agree. The result was a platform that fell short of its potential.\n\n## What Changed With My Acquisition\n\nSince acquiring Twitter and renaming it X, everything about the ownership dynamic has changed. I own the platform. I make the decisions. I bear the consequences.\n\nThis does not mean I always make the right calls. I have made mistakes and will make more. But there is now clarity of ownership and accountability that did not exist before. When people want to know who is responsible for X, the answer is simple: me.\n\nThe pre-acquisition ownership structure, with its dispersed shareholders, board politics, and institutional investors, is gone. X is now structured as a private company with a clear owner and a defined mission. Whether you agree with my decisions or not, you know exactly who is making them.\n\nThis is the fundamental change from who owned Twitter before to who owns X now. It went from many anonymous shareholders to one very public owner. From corporate consensus to individual conviction. From quarterly thinking to long-term vision.\n\n## Conclusion: From Public Platform to Private Vision\n\nSo who owned Twitter before Elon Musk? Technically, it was millions of shareholders around the world, from major institutions managing trillions of dollars to individual investors with a few shares in their brokerage accounts. Practically, it was a company without a true owner, governed by a board that balanced competing interests rather than pursuing a coherent vision.\n\nJack Dorsey and the original co-founders created Twitter, but they did not own it at the end. The venture capitalists funded its growth but cashed out along the way. The public shareholders held the stock but rarely engaged with the platform's mission.\n\nNow the platform is X, and I am the owner. The history of distributed public ownership explains why the platform needed transformation. The new reality of private ownership makes that transformation possible. Whether it succeeds or fails, the ownership question is now clear in a way it never was before.",
