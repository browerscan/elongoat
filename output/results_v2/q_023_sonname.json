  "title": "What Is Elon Musk's Son's Name? X AE A-12 and All My Sons (2025)",
  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: X AE A-12 and My Other Sons\n\nMy most famous son is X AE A-12, though we simply call him X. He was born on May 4, 2020, with Grimes, and yes, that name is real. But let me be clear: I have multiple sons. In total, I have ten sons and four daughters across my fourteen children.\n\nHere are all my sons' names: Nevada Alexander (who we lost in 2002), Griffin, Kai, Saxon, Damian, X AE A-Xii (the legal spelling after California's naming laws required modification), Strider, Techno Mechanicus, Seldon Lycurgus, and Romulus. Each name was chosen with intention. I do not believe in throwaway names that mean nothing.\n\nWhen people ask about my son's name, they usually mean X because his name broke the internet. Fair enough. The name caused regulatory headaches, international headlines, and endless memes. But I stand by it completely. Names should carry meaning, and X's name is loaded with significance.\n\n## The Full Story: How X AE A-12 Got His Name\n\nThe story of X's name begins with Grimes and me discussing what we wanted our child's name to represent. Both of us are deeply interested in technology, artificial intelligence, and aerospace. Neither of us had any interest in conventional naming.\n\nX is the unknown variable in mathematics. It represents possibility, the unsolved, the mysterious. When you see X in an equation, it means there is something to discover. I wanted my son to carry that sense of infinite potential.\n\nAE is Grimes' contribution. In her framework, it represents the elven spelling of AI, which stands for artificial intelligence. Grimes has a deep connection to art, music, and futurism, and she wanted to encode our shared interest in AI into our son's identity. Love is the AI of the gods, she said, and I found that poetic.\n\nA-12 references the Lockheed A-12, the precursor to the SR-71 Blackbird. The A-12 was the CIA's reconnaissance aircraft, developed at Skunk Works under conditions of extreme secrecy. It was faster and higher-flying than anything before it. The A-12 represents the pinnacle of aerospace engineering from an era when engineers pushed boundaries without being constrained by bureaucratic caution. Also, A represents Archangel, the internal project name. So A-12 means Archangel 12, which both Grimes and I thought was beautiful.\n\nThe combination of these elements creates X AE A-12: unknown variable, artificial intelligence love, and the fastest airplane ever built. It is a name that points toward the future.\n\nBut then California stepped in. California law states that names must use the 26 letters of the English alphabet. No numbers. No special characters. So we modified the birth certificate to read X AE A-Xii, using Roman numerals instead of Arabic numerals. The meaning remains identical. We still call him X.\n\nPronunciation has caused confusion. We pronounce it as a single syllable: X. Some people try to sound out the full name phonetically, which creates various interpretations. But in our family, he is simply X. Short, direct, memorable.\n\n## Key Details: All My Sons and Their Names\n\nLet me provide comprehensive information about all my sons, because the question of my son's name deserves a complete answer.\n\n**Nevada Alexander Musk (2002)**\nMy firstborn son with Justine Wilson. Nevada was born in 2002, and we lost him to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome when he was just ten weeks old. His death was the most difficult experience of my life. We named him Nevada because it evoked the wide-open spaces and frontier spirit that I have always found compelling. Alexander was a reference to Alexander the Great, the conqueror who pushed human civilization into new territories.\n\n**Griffin Musk (2004)**\nBorn via IVF as one of twins with his sister Vivian. Griffin is now in his early twenties. The name Griffin comes from the mythological creature that is half eagle and half lion. It represents the combination of intelligence and strength. Griffin is one of my older children who has seen me go through the Tesla and SpaceX struggles firsthand.\n\n**Kai Musk (2006)**\nOne of triplets born via IVF, along with Saxon and Damian. Kai is a name with multiple origins. In Hawaiian it means ocean, in Japanese it can mean forgiveness, in Mandarin it can mean victory. I liked the simplicity and the multicultural resonance. We live in a global civilization now.\n\n**Saxon Musk (2006)**\nAnother of the triplets. Saxon references the Germanic tribe that shaped English history and language. The Saxons were builders and settlers. I wanted a name that connected to the history of Western civilization while also sounding strong and distinctive.\n\n**Damian Musk (2006)**\nThe third triplet. Damian has Greek origins meaning to tame or to subdue. Some people associate it with the Omen films, but that was not our reference point. Damian was a common name in classical antiquity, and it has a certain gravitas.\n\n**X AE A-Xii Musk (2020)**\nBorn May 4, 2020, with Grimes. As I explained above, this name encodes our interests in mathematics, artificial intelligence, and aerospace engineering. X is the child who has been most photographed with me at public events, including during the Twitter acquisition. He has been to SpaceX launches. At his young age, he already shows curiosity about rockets and technology.\n\n**Strider Musk (2021)**\nBorn in November 2021 as one of twins with Azure, via my relationship with Shivon Zilis. Strider is a direct reference to Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings, whose ranger name is Strider. Tolkien's work has influenced me significantly. Aragorn was a rightful king who spent years working in the wilderness before claiming his destiny. The name represents perseverance and hidden potential.\n\n**Techno Mechanicus Musk (2022)**\nBorn with Grimes. Yes, I named my son Techno Mechanicus. The name is a reference to the Adeptus Mechanicus from the Warhammer 40,000 universe, the faction devoted to the Machine God and technological preservation. I am a massive Warhammer fan, and the Mechanicus represents the idea that technology is sacred and must be advanced. Some people think this name is satirical. It is not. We call him Techno.\n\n**Seldon Lycurgus Musk (2024)**\nBorn with Shivon Zilis. This name combines two figures who fascinate me. Hari Seldon is the protagonist of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, a mathematician who develops psychohistory to guide humanity through a dark age. Lycurgus was the legendary lawgiver of ancient Sparta who created the social system that allowed Sparta to become a military powerhouse. Both figures are about creating frameworks for civilization to survive and thrive.\n\n**Romulus Musk (2024)**\nAlso with Shivon Zilis. Romulus was the legendary founder of Rome who, with his brother Remus, was raised by a wolf. He went on to establish the city that became the center of Western civilization for a thousand years. The name represents founding, building, and creating something that lasts. Rome fell eventually, but its influence shaped everything that came after. I want my children to think in terms of building institutions and civilizations, not just companies.\n\n## My Perspective: Why Names Carry Meaning\n\nI take naming seriously because names shape identity. When you name a child something conventional, you are making a safe choice. There is nothing wrong with safety. But I have never been interested in doing things the conventional way.\n\nMy own name, Elon, is unusual. It comes from Hebrew and means oak tree. I was named after my great-grandfather. Growing up in South Africa with an unusual name taught me that being different is not a disadvantage. It can be a distinction.\n\nWhen I named X, I wanted to give him something that would spark curiosity. Every time someone asks about his name, it creates a conversation about mathematics, AI, or aerospace. The name is a teaching moment embedded in an identity.\n\nThe same logic applies to Techno Mechanicus. Will some people find it strange? Yes. But some people will recognize the reference and immediately understand something about our family's values. We believe technology is important. We believe in science fiction as a guide to the future. We believe in naming things honestly.\n\nI also think about the future. In fifty years, names like Techno or X will probably seem far less unusual than they do now. Naming conventions evolve. The names that seem normal today like Michael or Jennifer were once innovations. Someone was the first to use them.\n\nMy children's names are experiments in what naming can become. Not all experiments succeed, but I would rather experiment than follow the crowd.\n\n## Common Misconceptions About My Sons' Names\n\nLet me clear up some frequent misunderstandings.\n\n**Misconception: X AE A-12 is a joke or publicity stunt**\nNo. Grimes and I spent significant time developing this name. Every component has meaning. We did not wake up and randomly generate characters. The name reflects our genuine interests and values. The fact that it generated publicity was incidental, not intentional.\n\n**Misconception: The name cannot be pronounced**\nIt is pronounced X. One syllable. Like the letter. Some people try to phonetically decode AE A-12, producing sounds like Ash or Kyle. But we simply say X.\n\n**Misconception: California forced us to change the name entirely**\nCalifornia required us to remove the numeric characters. We replaced 12 with XII, the Roman numeral equivalent. The meaning is unchanged. The bureaucracy was accommodated without compromise.\n\n**Misconception: My older sons have normal names**\nGriffin, Kai, Saxon, and Damian are less unusual than X, but they are not exactly common either. Saxon in particular is quite rare. I have always preferred names with historical or mythological resonance.\n\n**Misconception: These names will harm my children**\nPeople said the same thing about unusual celebrity baby names for decades. In my experience, distinctive names give children confidence in their individuality. My children are not ordinary, and their names reflect that.\n\n**Misconception: Grimes chose all the unusual names**\nWhile Grimes contributed significantly to X and Y's names, many of the classical references like Romulus, Seldon, and Lycurgus reflect my own interests. The futuristic and classical naming approaches complement each other.\n\n## Looking Forward: Names for Future Generations\n\nI hope my sons will someday have children of their own and continue the tradition of meaningful naming. Imagine a future where Seldon Lycurgus names his son after another civilization builder, or where X names his child something that points toward technologies we have not yet invented.\n\nNaming traditions create family identity across generations. The Musk family naming approach, whether people find it unusual or not, establishes a pattern. We name our children after ideas, not conventions. We look to science fiction, classical history, and mathematical concepts rather than popularity charts.\n\nI do not know if I will have more children. But if I do, you can expect the names to continue this pattern. There are many historical figures, mathematical concepts, and science fiction references that have not yet been used. The naming project is ongoing.\n\nSome of my sons may choose conventional names for their own children, and that is fine. Each generation makes its own choices. But I hope they will at least consider names with meaning, names that encode values and aspirations.\n\n## Final Thoughts on My Sons' Names\n\nWhen someone asks what is my son's name, the simple answer is X AE A-12, the one that made headlines. But the complete answer includes ten sons across two decades: Nevada, Griffin, Kai, Saxon, Damian, X, Strider, Techno, Seldon, and Romulus.\n\nEach name tells a story. Nevada was the frontier. Griffin was the mythological guardian. The triplets Kai, Saxon, and Damian drew from global and historical cultures. X represented the unknown and artificial intelligence. Strider invoked Tolkien's rightful king. Techno Mechanicus declared our reverence for technology. Seldon Lycurgus combined science fiction with classical lawgiving. And Romulus pointed to the founding of civilization itself.\n\nThese are not random choices. They are deliberate statements about what I value: exploration, mythology, technology, literature, history, and civilization-building. My sons carry these references in their names, and I hope the meanings will influence how they think about themselves and the world.\n\nPeople will continue to find my naming choices unusual. I am comfortable with that. Unusual is not wrong. It is different. And different can be better.",
