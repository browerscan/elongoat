  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: I Lead the Department of Government Efficiency\n\nI serve as a senior advisor to President Donald Trump, specifically leading the Department of Government Efficiency, which we call DOGE. Yes, the name is intentional. My role is to identify and eliminate wasteful government spending, cut unnecessary regulations, and restructure federal agencies to operate more like well-run private companies. I am not a cabinet secretary in the traditional sense. I am an outside advisor bringing Silicon Valley efficiency principles to a government that desperately needs them.\n\nThe scope is massive. The federal government spends over 6 trillion dollars annually. My initial target was to identify at least 2 trillion dollars in potential savings and efficiency gains. That is not a small number, and achieving it requires challenging entrenched bureaucracies, questioning every line item, and being willing to make decisions that career politicians have avoided for decades.\n\n## How I Came to Work With Trump\n\nLet me explain how this happened because the partnership surprised many people. During the 2024 presidential campaign, I became increasingly concerned about the trajectory of American governance. The regulatory burden on companies like Tesla and SpaceX had become absurd. The federal deficit was spiraling. Government agencies seemed to exist primarily to perpetuate themselves rather than serve citizens.\n\nI endorsed Donald Trump in July 2024 after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. That moment crystallized something for me. Regardless of political disagreements, we were witnessing someone willing to take enormous personal risks for what they believed in. I respected that.\n\nMy support was not passive. I contributed over 250 million dollars to pro-Trump political action committees, making me one of the largest individual political donors in American history. I did this because I believed the alternative trajectory for America was unsustainable. Some people called this buying influence. I call it putting my money where my mouth is.\n\nAfter the election victory in November 2024, President-elect Trump asked me to take on a formal advisory role. The Department of Government Efficiency was announced in November 2024, with me as the leader alongside Vivek Ramaswamy. Vivek later stepped back to pursue other opportunities, leaving me as the primary driver of the initiative.\n\n## What DOGE Actually Does\n\nLet me be specific about the work because there is a lot of confusion and misinformation.\n\nFirst, we conduct comprehensive audits of federal spending. Every agency, every program, every contract. We look for redundancy, waste, fraud, and programs that have outlived their usefulness. The federal government has programs created decades ago that nobody can explain the current purpose of. We find them and question them.\n\nSecond, we identify regulatory barriers that impede economic growth without providing meaningful benefits. At Tesla, we dealt with regulations that added months or years to projects without improving safety or environmental outcomes. The same pattern exists across every industry. We are systematically reviewing regulations and recommending eliminations.\n\nThird, we propose workforce restructuring. The federal government employs over 2 million civilian workers. Many are dedicated public servants. But the bureaucracy has grown bloated, with layers of management that slow decision-making without adding value. We recommend flattening hierarchies and reducing headcount through attrition and voluntary separations.\n\nFourth, we leverage technology to automate processes that currently require human intervention. The private sector automated many routine tasks years ago. Government has lagged dramatically. Simple things like processing applications, answering citizen inquiries, and managing records can be handled by AI systems, freeing human workers for tasks that actually require human judgment.\n\nFifth, we renegotiate contracts. The federal government is the largest purchaser of goods and services in the world, but it often pays premium prices because of procurement rules designed more for process compliance than value. We push for better deals.\n\n## My Specific Activities and Involvement\n\nI spend significant time in Washington now, which I never anticipated. I meet regularly with agency heads, budget officials, and congressional leaders. I have direct access to President Trump and participate in policy discussions at the highest levels.\n\nMy approach is the same as running my companies. I ask basic questions that people have stopped asking. Why does this program exist? What would happen if we eliminated it? How much does this actually cost when you include all the indirect expenses? What is the measurable outcome? If we were building this from scratch today, would we do it this way?\n\nThese questions often have no good answers, which tells you everything you need to know.\n\nI have also testified before Congress and engaged with the media to explain our findings. Transparency is important. The American people deserve to know how their money is spent and why certain cuts are being proposed.\n\nOne controversial aspect is my recommendation for significant reductions in force at certain agencies. This has generated pushback from federal employee unions and some members of Congress. But I believe we have an obligation to taxpayers to not employ more people than necessary to accomplish the mission. Every unnecessary government employee represents money that could have been left in the economy or spent on actual priorities.\n\n## The Controversy and Criticism\n\nI am not naive about the criticism. Let me address the main objections directly.\n\nFirst, people say I have conflicts of interest because my companies do business with the government. This is true. SpaceX has contracts with NASA and the Department of Defense. Tesla competes for government fleet contracts. But the solution to conflicts of interest is transparency and recusal, not disengagement. I recuse myself from any decisions that directly affect my companies. Having business experience with government actually gives me insight into where the problems are.\n\nSecond, critics argue that an unelected billionaire should not have this kind of influence over government policy. I understand the concern. But advisory roles for business leaders are not unprecedented. What matters is whether the advice is good. Judge me by the results, not by my wealth.\n\nThird, some claim I am using this position to settle scores against agencies that regulated my companies. The FAA delayed Starship launches. The SEC has been a persistent annoyance. But my recommendations are based on objective analysis of efficiency and necessity, not personal grievances. If anything, my experience with these agencies gives me better insight into their dysfunction.\n\nFourth, there are accusations that proposed cuts will harm vulnerable populations who depend on government services. This is a legitimate concern that I take seriously. Not all spending cuts are good. The goal is to cut waste while preserving essential services. We focus on administrative overhead, not benefits that go directly to citizens in need.\n\n## What We Have Accomplished So Far\n\nBy early 2025, we have already identified hundreds of billions in potential savings. Some highlights:\n\nWe found duplicate programs across agencies doing essentially the same thing with no coordination. Consolidating these eliminates overhead while maintaining services.\n\nWe identified contracts where the government was paying significantly above market rates for goods and services. Renegotiating these saves money immediately.\n\nWe proposed eliminating certain agencies entirely where the functions could be absorbed by other agencies or returned to states. This is controversial but necessary for meaningful reform.\n\nWe recommended technology investments that will reduce long-term costs by automating routine processes. The upfront investment pays for itself within years.\n\nWe pushed for reforms to federal hiring and firing practices to make the workforce more accountable. Currently, it is nearly impossible to fire underperforming federal employees. This creates a culture of complacency.\n\n## My Vision for Government Efficiency\n\nLet me share what I am ultimately trying to achieve because it goes beyond just cutting spending.\n\nI want government to work. Not to be smaller for its own sake, but to be effective. Citizens deserve agencies that respond quickly, processes that make sense, and tax dollars spent wisely. The current system fails on all these counts.\n\nAt SpaceX, we build rockets for a fraction of what traditional aerospace contractors charge. At Tesla, we manufacture cars more efficiently than legacy automakers. These are not magic. They result from first-principles thinking, questioning assumptions, and relentless focus on outcomes over process.\n\nGovernment can operate this way too. It just requires the will to challenge how things have always been done. Bureaucracies naturally accumulate complexity and resist change. External pressure is necessary to drive reform.\n\nI also believe in making government more transparent. Citizens should be able to easily see where their money goes and what they get for it. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. When people can see the waste clearly, there is political pressure to fix it.\n\n## My Relationship With President Trump\n\nPeople are curious about how I work with the President. We communicate regularly. He is genuinely interested in efficiency and cutting waste. He built his career in business and understands that organizations become bloated without constant vigilance.\n\nWe do not agree on everything. No two people do. But we share a fundamental belief that American government has grown too large, too slow, and too expensive. That common ground is sufficient for productive collaboration.\n\nI respect that he gave me this platform. Most politicians talk about cutting government but lack the will to actually do it because every cut affects some constituency. Having outside support from someone without electoral concerns provides political cover for difficult decisions.\n\nMy role is advisory. The President and Congress make the actual decisions. But I can provide analysis, recommendations, and public advocacy for reforms that might otherwise be politically impossible.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nDOGE is intended to be a temporary initiative. The goal is not to create another permanent government body but to achieve specific reforms and then step back. I have companies to run. I cannot do this indefinitely.\n\nBut I hope the changes we implement become permanent. Efficiency should not require a special department. It should be embedded in how government operates every day. If we can shift the culture even slightly toward questioning waste and measuring outcomes, the effects will compound over time.\n\nI am also thinking about how this work applies beyond the federal government. State and local governments face similar challenges. The principles are transferable.\n\nCritics will continue to criticize. That is fine. What matters is whether we actually reduce spending, eliminate useless regulations, and make government work better for citizens. History will judge the results.\n\n## Final Thoughts on Serving in This Role\n\nSome people ask why I am doing this when I could focus entirely on my companies. The honest answer is that I see government dysfunction as a threat to everything I am trying to build. SpaceX cannot make humanity multiplanetary if regulations prevent us from launching. Tesla cannot accelerate sustainable energy if bureaucracy slows every project. Neuralink cannot help people if approval processes take decades.\n\nBut it goes beyond self-interest. I am an American citizen. I believe in this country. I want it to succeed. When I see waste and inefficiency that harms taxpayers and reduces our competitiveness, I feel obligated to help fix it if I can.\n\nThis is not a power grab. I am not running for office. I have no desire to accumulate political power. I want to solve problems, improve systems, and get back to building rockets and cars. If we can make government more efficient along the way, everyone benefits.\n\nSo that is what I do for Trump. I lead DOGE. I identify waste. I recommend cuts. I push for efficiency. I take the criticism. And I try to make government work a little better than I found it. It is a strange addition to my job portfolio, but someone had to do it.",
