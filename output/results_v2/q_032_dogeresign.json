  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: No, I Have Not Resigned From DOGE\n\nNo, I have not resigned from DOGE. As of late 2025, I remain fully committed to leading the Department of Government Efficiency alongside Vivek Ramaswamy. Let me be absolutely clear about this because there has been considerable speculation and misinformation circulating online. I am still the head of DOGE, and we are actively working to slash wasteful government spending and bureaucratic inefficiency.\n\nThe rumor mill has been working overtime since the beginning of our mission. Every time I focus more publicly on SpaceX or xAI for a week, headlines appear asking whether I have abandoned DOGE. I have not. This is a multi-year commitment, and I take it seriously.\n\n## What DOGE Actually Is and Why I Took This On\n\nLet me explain what DOGE is because there is substantial confusion about its structure and mandate. The Department of Government Efficiency is not a traditional government department in the cabinet sense. It is an advisory body created by President Trump to identify and eliminate wasteful spending, redundant programs, and bureaucratic bloat across the federal government.\n\nWhen Trump asked me to lead this effort after the 2024 election, I did not take the decision lightly. Running Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and X is already demanding. But I believe the federal government has become dangerously bloated and inefficient to the point where it threatens America's long-term competitiveness and fiscal stability.\n\nThe name DOGE was intentional. Yes, it references the Dogecoin meme. But more importantly, it signals that we are approaching this with a sense of irreverence toward sacred cows and bureaucratic traditions. The federal government spends trillions of dollars annually, and a significant portion of that spending is wasteful, duplicative, or actively counterproductive. Someone needs to challenge the status quo aggressively.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy and I are co-leads. Vivek brings his own experience as an entrepreneur and his deep understanding of regulatory capture and pharmaceutical industry dynamics. We complement each other well. He focuses on certain areas while I concentrate on others, but we coordinate regularly on overall strategy and priorities.\n\n## Our Progress and Accomplishments So Far\n\nSince DOGE began operations in January 2025, we have made significant progress that the mainstream media largely ignores or downplays. Let me share some concrete accomplishments.\n\nFirst, we conducted a comprehensive audit of federal spending across all departments. This was not a superficial review. We went line by line through budgets, identifying programs that have outlived their usefulness, offices that perform redundant functions, and contracts that deliver poor value for taxpayers.\n\nSecond, we identified over $500 billion in potential annual savings through a combination of program eliminations, consolidations, renegotiated contracts, and workforce reductions. Some of these recommendations have already been implemented. Others are working their way through the political process.\n\nThird, we successfully pushed for the elimination or restructuring of several agencies and programs that had become monuments to bureaucratic inertia. I cannot name all of them here because some are still being finalized, but the cumulative effect will be substantial.\n\nFourth, we introduced private sector efficiency practices into government operations. This includes rigorous metrics, accountability measures, and the radical concept that government workers should actually produce measurable results. The resistance from entrenched bureaucrats has been fierce, which tells me we are on the right track.\n\n## Why People Think I Resigned\n\nThe resignation rumors seem to stem from several sources, and I want to address each one directly.\n\nFirst, my time is genuinely divided across multiple ventures. When I spend a few weeks intensely focused on a SpaceX Starship launch or an xAI development milestone, my DOGE activities receive less public attention. This does not mean I have stepped back. It means I am managing multiple priorities, which I have done my entire career.\n\nSecond, some media outlets are hostile to DOGE's mission and would love to report its failure. They interpret any perceived reduction in my involvement as evidence of abandonment. This is wishful thinking on their part, not reality.\n\nThird, the political opposition to DOGE has been intense. Unions representing federal workers, contractors who benefit from current arrangements, and politicians whose districts receive disproportionate federal spending all have incentives to undermine our work. One tactic is to spread rumors that the effort is falling apart or that I have lost interest.\n\nFourth, some people conflated temporary adjustments to our timeline with resignation. We initially talked about completing much of our work by July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of American independence. Some aspects of that timeline have been adjusted based on political and practical realities. Adjusting a timeline is not the same as quitting.\n\n## The Challenges We Face\n\nI am not going to pretend this has been easy. The obstacles to reforming government are immense, and I want to be transparent about what we are up against.\n\nBureaucratic resistance is the most immediate challenge. Federal employees whose jobs are threatened by efficiency improvements have every incentive to obstruct, delay, and undermine our recommendations. Many have been in their positions for decades and know how to slow-walk any initiative they dislike.\n\nLegal constraints are significant. Many programs and agencies are created by Congress, meaning we cannot simply shut them down by executive action. We can recommend, but Congress must act. And Congress is not exactly known for swift, decisive action.\n\nPolitical opposition spans both parties in some cases. While Republicans generally support our mission, individual members resist cuts that affect their constituents or donors. Some Democrats oppose everything we do on principle, regardless of merit.\n\nMedia hostility makes it difficult to communicate our successes. When we identify a wasteful program, the coverage focuses on the jobs that might be lost rather than the taxpayers who will be saved billions. When we propose common-sense reforms, the headlines emphasize the disruption rather than the benefits.\n\nThe sheer scale of federal operations is daunting. The federal government employs over two million civilian workers, spends over six trillion dollars annually, and operates countless programs accumulated over more than two centuries. Reforming this leviathan is not a six-month project. It is a generational undertaking.\n\n## My Commitment Going Forward\n\nLet me be explicit about my commitment. I agreed to lead DOGE because I believe it is essential for America's future. That belief has not changed. If anything, the resistance we have encountered has reinforced my conviction that this work is necessary.\n\nI plan to continue leading DOGE for as long as it takes to achieve meaningful reforms. This is not about a title or political positioning. It is about actually making the government work better for the American people who pay for it.\n\nWill I eventually step back? Perhaps. But that will happen when the mission is accomplished or when someone better suited can take over, not because I grew bored or encountered resistance. I do not abandon things I care about because they are difficult.\n\nMy companies have always involved long timelines and persistent effort. SpaceX took many years and multiple failed launches before landing a rocket. Tesla nearly died multiple times before becoming the world's most valuable automaker. DOGE faces different challenges, but the mindset is the same: keep pushing until you succeed.\n\n## What Comes Next for DOGE\n\nOur next phase focuses on several priorities that I can share publicly.\n\nFirst, we are working with Congress on legislative reforms that will make our recommendations permanent. Executive actions can be reversed by future administrations. Legislative changes are more durable.\n\nSecond, we are expanding our focus to regulatory reform. It is not just about cutting spending. It is also about eliminating the regulatory barriers that make it harder for Americans to start businesses, build homes, and create prosperity.\n\nThird, we are developing technology solutions to make government operations more efficient. Artificial intelligence can automate many tasks currently performed by armies of bureaucrats. This is not about eliminating all government workers. It is about redirecting human effort toward tasks that actually require human judgment.\n\nFourth, we are building public support for reform by communicating directly with taxpayers about how their money is being spent and wasted. The more Americans understand the current dysfunction, the more they will demand change.\n\n## Addressing Speculation About Internal Conflicts\n\nSome reports have suggested tensions between me and Vivek or between DOGE and other parts of the administration. Let me address this directly.\n\nVivek and I disagree on some things. That is healthy. If we agreed on everything, one of us would be unnecessary. Our disagreements are about tactics and priorities, not about the fundamental mission. We debate, we decide, we move forward. This is how effective teams work.\n\nRegarding the administration, there have been moments of friction. Not everyone in government welcomes outsiders telling them their operations are inefficient. Some cabinet members have been more receptive than others. But President Trump's support for our mission has been consistent, and that is what matters most.\n\n## Why This Matters Beyond Politics\n\nI want to close by explaining why DOGE matters beyond the current political moment.\n\nThe federal government's trajectory is unsustainable. The national debt exceeds $35 trillion. Annual deficits are measured in trillions. Entitlement spending consumes an ever-larger share of the budget. At some point, this ends badly, either through a debt crisis, inflation, or severe cuts to essential services.\n\nDOGE is an attempt to change this trajectory before crisis forces change upon us. The reforms we are pursuing today will determine whether our children and grandchildren inherit a functioning nation or a fiscal disaster.\n\nThis is why I took on this responsibility despite already having more than enough on my plate. Some problems are too important to leave to others. Government efficiency is one of them.\n\nSo no, I have not resigned from DOGE. I am still here, still pushing, still committed to making the federal government work for the people who fund it. The rumors of my departure are premature at best and deliberately misleading at worst. Watch what we do, not what the rumor mills say.",
