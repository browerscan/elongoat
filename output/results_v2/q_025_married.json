  "answer": "## I'm Not Currently Married\n\nLet me be crystal clear: I'm not married to anyone right now. I know there's a lot of speculation and outdated information floating around the internet, but as of today, I'm single in the legal sense. No wife, no current marriage certificate, though my personal life has certainly been eventful over the years.\n\nPeople seem fascinated by my relationships, probably because they're trying to reconcile how someone can run multiple companies while also having a family life. The truth is, it's complicated, and I've made my share of mistakes along the way. But I've also been blessed with incredible children and relationships that have shaped who I am today.\n\n## The Full Story of My Marriages and Relationships\n\nMy romantic history isn't exactly simple, so let me walk you through it chronologically. I've been married three times to two different women, which I know sounds confusing, but bear with me.\n\n### Justine Musk (2000-2008)\n\nMy first marriage was to Justine Wilson, now Justine Musk. We met when I was at Queen's University in Ontario, and she was studying at the same institution. We got married in 2000, right as I was building PayPal and beginning my entrepreneurial journey in earnest.\n\nOur marriage produced six children, though tragically, our first son, Nevada Alexander, died at 10 weeks old from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). That loss devastated both of us in ways that are difficult to describe. We went on to have five more sons through IVF: twins Griffin and Xavier (now Vivian), and triplets Kai, Saxon, and Damian.\n\nJustine and I divorced in 2008. She's been open about the challenges of our marriage, particularly regarding how consumed I was with work. Looking back, I can see how my intense focus on Tesla and SpaceX during their most critical early years put tremendous strain on our relationship. She's an accomplished author now, and we co-parent our children.\n\n### Talulah Riley (2010-2012, 2013-2016)\n\nThen came Talulah Riley, a British actress I met in 2008. We married in 2010, divorced in 2012, remarried in 2013, and divorced again in 2016. Yes, I married the same woman twice. If that doesn't tell you something about the complexity of human relationships, I don't know what does.\n\nTalulah is brilliant and talented, and we genuinely cared for each other. But the pattern was clear: my work commitments and the demands of running multiple companies made it nearly impossible to maintain a traditional marriage. We tried twice because we wanted it to work, but ultimately, the same fundamental issues remained. We've stayed on good terms, which I'm grateful for.\n\n### Relationship with Grimes (2018-2021)\n\nAfter Talulah, I started dating Claire Boucher, known professionally as Grimes, around 2018. We connected over a nerdy joke about artificial intelligence and Roko's basilisk, which probably tells you everything you need to know about how my brain works when it comes to attraction.\n\nGrimes and I never married, but we have two children together: our son X AE A-XII (we call him X) born in May 2020, and our daughter Exa Dark Sidereal (Y) born in December 2021 via surrogate. Our relationship has been on-and-off, what you might call \"semi-separated\" or \"fluid.\" We're not together in a traditional sense, but we're co-parenting and maintain a connection.\n\nIn 2022, it also became public that I had twins with Shivon Zilis, an executive at Neuralink, born in November 2021. So yes, I had children with two different women within weeks of each other. I've never claimed to have a conventional personal life.\n\n## Key Details About My Marital History\n\nLet me break down the numbers for clarity:\n\n- **Total marriages:** 3\n- **Total divorces:** 3\n- **Number of different spouses:** 2 (Justine once, Talulah twice)\n- **Total children:** 11 living children (as of my last count)\n- **Mothers of my children:** 3 (Justine, Grimes, Shivon)\n- **Current marital status:** Single/unmarried\n\nI've been open about my belief that declining birth rates are one of the greatest threats to civilization. I've tried to do my part to address that concern, and I'm deeply involved in my children's lives, even if the arrangements aren't conventional. I see my kids regularly, though admittedly, coordinating schedules across multiple households while running Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), Neuralink, and The Boring Company is logistically challenging.\n\n## My Perspective on Work-Life Balance\n\nPeople often ask me how I balance work and family. The honest answer? I don't, not in the traditional sense. I work 80-100 hour weeks when things are critical, which they often are when you're trying to revolutionize transportation, make humanity multiplanetary, and merge human consciousness with AI.\n\nMy relationships have suffered because of this. I've been told I'm not emotionally available enough, that I prioritize work over personal connections. There's truth to those criticisms. When Tesla was weeks away from bankruptcy in 2008, I was sleeping on the factory floor. When SpaceX was on its fourth launch attempt with our last remaining money, I couldn't think about anything else.\n\nBut I've also learned that my children need me present, not just financially supporting them. I've made more effort in recent years to involve them in what I'm doing, to spend quality time with them, to be there for important moments. It's still not enough, and I know that. But I'm trying to be better.\n\nThe reality is that the mission drives me. Making humanity a multi-planetary species, solving sustainable energy, preventing AI catastrophe—these aren't 9-to-5 jobs. They require everything I have. That makes me a difficult partner, I know that. I have tremendous respect for the women who've been in my life and dealt with my intensity and single-minded focus.\n\n## Common Misconceptions About My Current Status\n\nLet me clear up some rumors I've seen online:\n\n**Misconception 1: I'm secretly married.** No, I'm not. My marital status is public record. If I get married, you'll know about it because it'll be in the public filings.\n\n**Misconception 2: I'm currently with Grimes.** Our relationship is complicated and has evolved over time. We're not together in a traditional sense, but we're not completely separated either. We're co-parenting and figuring things out as we go.\n\n**Misconception 3: I don't care about relationships.** I do care, deeply. Just because I haven't been successful at maintaining traditional marriages doesn't mean I don't value human connection. I've simply struggled to balance it with the magnitude of the work I'm trying to accomplish.\n\n**Misconception 4: I'm looking for a new wife.** I'm not actively looking for anything. If the right person comes along and we connect, great. But I'm not on dating apps or actively searching. I'm focused on my companies and my children.\n\n## Looking Forward: Family and Future Priorities\n\nAs I get older, my perspective on family has evolved. I have 11 children now, and that number might grow. I believe strongly in having large families and have encouraged others to have more children if they're able. The demographic collapse is real, and we need to take it seriously.\n\nMy priority is being a good father to the children I have. That means being present, teaching them, involving them in the work I'm doing when appropriate, and making sure they grow up with good values and critical thinking skills. I've made mistakes as a father, just as I have as a husband, but I'm committed to learning and improving.\n\nWill I marry again? I don't know. I'm not opposed to it, but I'm also not seeking it out. If I meet someone who understands the demands of what I'm trying to accomplish, who shares similar values about the future of humanity, and who wants to be part of this chaotic, intense life, then maybe. But I'm not going to force it.\n\nWhat I do know is that my children are becoming more important to me, not less. As SpaceX gets closer to making Mars colonization a reality, as Tesla approaches full self-driving, as Neuralink begins human trials—these milestones are things I want to share with my kids. I want them to understand what we're building and why it matters.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nSo to directly answer the question: I'm not married to anyone. I'm a single father of 11 children with three different women. I've been married three times and divorced three times. My personal life has been messy, complicated, and far from the traditional ideal.\n\nBut I've also been incredibly fortunate to have had meaningful relationships with brilliant, talented women. I have amazing children who give me hope for the future. And while I haven't figured out the work-life balance equation, I'm still trying.\n\nThe work I'm doing will outlast any of my personal relationships. In 100 years, people won't remember who I was married to or how many times I divorced. They'll remember whether we made it to Mars, whether we solved sustainable energy, whether we navigated the AI transition safely. That's what drives me every day.\n\nDoes that mean I'm a perfect person? Absolutely not. I have flaws, I've made mistakes, and I've hurt people I cared about. But I'm trying to do something meaningful with the time I have on this planet, and I'm trying to be a good father to my children. That's the best I can do.\n\nIf you're reading this because you're curious about my personal life, I hope this gives you a complete picture. I'm not hiding anything. My life is complicated, my relationships have been complicated, and I'm not currently married. That's the truth.",
