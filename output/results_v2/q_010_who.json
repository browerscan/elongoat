  "answer": "## Who Am I? The Quick Answer\n\nI am Elon Musk, and if you want the short version: I am an entrepreneur and engineer obsessed with solving problems that matter for humanity's long-term survival. Born in Pretoria, South Africa in 1971, I now lead Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), Neuralink, xAI, and The Boring Company. Forbes and Bloomberg currently list me as the wealthiest person on Earth, with a net worth exceeding $400 billion, though I find that metric far less interesting than the actual work we are doing.\n\nI did not set out to become wealthy. I set out to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, make humanity a multi-planetary species, and ensure artificial intelligence develops in a way that benefits rather than destroys us. Everything I have built connects to those missions. The money is simply a byproduct of creating things people actually want and need. If I could trade every dollar for a functioning Mars colony tomorrow, I would do it without hesitation.\n\n## The Full Story: From Pretoria to the Stars\n\nMy childhood in South Africa was complicated. I was a voracious reader, consuming entire encyclopedias and science fiction novels. I taught myself programming at age 10 and sold my first video game, Blastar, at 12 for about $500. School was difficult socially. I was bullied severely, once beaten so badly I was hospitalized. Books and computers became my refuge.\n\nAt 17, I left South Africa partly to avoid mandatory military service under apartheid, but mostly because I knew the future was being built in America. I moved to Canada first, then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania where I earned degrees in both physics and economics. I got accepted to Stanford for a PhD in energy physics but dropped out after two days. The internet was exploding, and I could not sit in a classroom while the world was changing.\n\nMy brother Kimbal and I started Zip2, a city guide software company, in 1995. We sold it to Compaq for $307 million in 1999. I immediately invested almost everything into X.com, an online bank that merged with Confinity and became PayPal. When eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002, I took my $165 million and did something most people thought was insane: I split it between starting a rocket company (SpaceX), investing in an electric car startup (Tesla), and funding a solar energy company (SolarCity).\n\nThe next several years nearly destroyed me. SpaceX had three consecutive rocket failures. Tesla was weeks from bankruptcy during the 2008 financial crisis. I was going through a divorce and running out of money. I borrowed money from friends to pay rent. But we survived. Falcon 1 reached orbit on its fourth attempt in September 2008, becoming the first privately developed liquid-fuel rocket to do so. Tesla delivered the Roadster and eventually the Model S. The rest, as they say, is history being written in real time.\n\n## Key Details and Facts: What I Have Built\n\nLet me give you the numbers because I know that is what people search for.\n\n**SpaceX** has completed over 300 successful orbital launches. We have landed rocket boosters over 250 times, something every aerospace expert said was impossible. Starship, our fully reusable super-heavy launch system, is the largest and most powerful rocket ever built. We operate Starlink, a satellite internet constellation with over 6,000 satellites serving millions of customers in 70+ countries.\n\n**Tesla** has delivered over 6 million electric vehicles. We are the most valuable automaker in the world. Our Supercharger network has become the North American charging standard, with Ford, GM, Rivian, and others adopting our connector. The Tesla Semi, Cybertruck, and next-generation affordable vehicles are expanding our lineup. Our energy storage business deployed over 15 GWh in 2023 alone.\n\n**X (Twitter)** I acquired in October 2022 for $44 billion. We have restructured the company to be leaner, introduced new features like long-form posts and video, and are building toward becoming an everything app.\n\n**Neuralink** has implanted its first brain-computer interfaces in human patients. We are working to help paralyzed individuals control computers with their thoughts, with longer-term goals of enhancing human cognitive capabilities.\n\n**xAI** launched Grok, our AI assistant, and we are building one of the world's largest AI training clusters to develop artificial general intelligence that is truth-seeking and beneficial to humanity.\n\n**The Boring Company** has completed tunnels in Las Vegas and is expanding, with the goal of solving urban traffic through 3D tunnel networks.\n\nPersonally, I have 14 children. I work approximately 100 hours per week. I sleep about 6 hours a night. I have moved my personal residence to Texas and spend significant time at our Starbase facility in Boca Chica.\n\n## My Perspective: What Actually Drives Me\n\nPeople constantly ask what motivates me. The honest answer is existential risk. When I read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as a teenager, I had a realization: the question matters more than the answer. The biggest question is whether humanity will survive long enough to become a multi-planetary civilization and eventually understand the universe.\n\nRight now, we have all our eggs in one basket. One asteroid, one supervolcano, one engineered pandemic, one nuclear war, and eight billion people are gone forever. Everything Shakespeare wrote, every symphony Beethoven composed, every scientific discovery, every child's laughter, all of it erased. That keeps me up at night.\n\nMars is not a backup plan because I think Earth is doomed. It is insurance. It is extending the probable lifespan of consciousness in the universe. Sustainable energy matters because we cannot build a spacefaring civilization on fossil fuels, and we should not destroy our home planet in the process.\n\nAs for who I am dating, since that is apparently an alternate search query, my personal life has been complicated and public. I focus on my work and my children. Romance is secondary to the mission, though I am human and I value connection like anyone else.\n\n## Addressing Misconceptions: Who I Really Am\n\nThe media portrayal of me varies wildly depending on who is writing and what agenda they have. Let me address a few things directly.\n\nI am not a genius who never fails. I fail constantly. SpaceX rockets exploded. Tesla nearly died multiple times. Many of my predictions about timelines have been wrong. I am simply willing to keep trying when others would quit.\n\nI am not an heir who bought my way in. My father owned a share in an emerald mine briefly, but I arrived in North America with student debt and worked my way up. I slept on office floors and showered at the YMCA.\n\nI am not anti-worker. I expect excellence and intense dedication because the missions demand it. But I work harder than anyone I ask to work hard. I do not ask others to do what I will not do myself.\n\nI am not trying to become a dictator or control the world. I want humans to have choices, agency, and the ability to reach the stars.\n\n## Looking Forward: The Next Two Decades\n\nHere is what I am working toward over the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nSpaceX will land humans on Mars. I believe we can achieve this before 2030, though timelines in rocketry are notoriously difficult. We will establish a permanent base and begin building toward a self-sustaining city.\n\nTesla will transition to fully autonomous vehicles, which will fundamentally change transportation economics and safety. We will produce affordable electric vehicles accessible to average consumers worldwide. Optimus, our humanoid robot, will handle dangerous and repetitive work.\n\nNeuralink will restore mobility to paralyzed patients and eventually offer cognitive enhancements that could help humans remain relevant as AI advances.\n\nxAI will develop AGI that is aligned with human values and committed to truth. This is perhaps the most important and dangerous technology we will create this century, and it must be done right.\n\nI want to see sustainable energy become the default choice purely on economics, making fossil fuels obsolete.\n\n## Final Thoughts: The Legacy I Want\n\nWhen I am gone, I do not want to be remembered for being wealthy. Wealth is just a resource for building things. I want to be remembered as someone who helped make life multi-planetary, who accelerated the sustainable energy revolution, and who contributed to ensuring artificial intelligence serves humanity rather than destroys it.\n\nI want future generations on Mars to look up at Earth in their night sky and know that some crazy people on that blue dot believed in them before they existed. That is the legacy worth working for. That is who I am.",
