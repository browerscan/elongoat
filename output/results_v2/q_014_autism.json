  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: Yes, I Have Asperger's Syndrome\n\nLet me be absolutely clear from the start: yes, I have Asperger's syndrome, which is a form of autism spectrum disorder. I announced this publicly during my opening monologue on Saturday Night Live on May 8, 2021. I said, \"I'm actually making history tonight as the first person with Asperger's to host SNL. Or at least the first to admit it.\"\n\nAsperger's syndrome is characterized by differences in social interaction, communication patterns, and often includes intense focus on specific interests. For me, those interests have always been physics, engineering, technology, and understanding how things work at a fundamental level.\n\n## The Full Story: Growing Up Different\n\nGrowing up in Pretoria, South Africa, I always knew I was different from other kids. I was incredibly awkward socially, often missing cues that seemed obvious to everyone else. While other children were playing sports or socializing, I was reading encyclopedias and programming computers. By age 10, I had taught myself computer programming, and by 12, I had sold my first video game, Blastar, for about $500.\n\nSchool was difficult, not academically, but socially. I was severely bullied, once beaten so badly that I was hospitalized. I did not understand the unwritten social rules that other kids seemed to grasp intuitively.\n\nMy mother, Maye, recognized early on that I was different. She has spoken about how I would often seem lost in thought, completely absorbed in whatever problem I was working on. I could spend hours, sometimes days, focused on a single idea or project, forgetting to eat or sleep.\n\n## Key Details About My Autism\n\n**Social Communication**: I process social situations differently than neurotypical people. Small talk does not come naturally to me. I often take things literally and can miss sarcasm or subtle social cues. In meetings, I tend to be direct to the point that some people find abrasive.\n\n**Sensory Sensitivities**: Certain sounds, textures, and environments can be overwhelming. This is why I often seem uncomfortable in certain social situations or large gatherings.\n\n**Hyperfocus**: When I am working on a problem that interests me, I can maintain concentration for extraordinarily long periods. I have been known to work 100-hour weeks when solving critical engineering challenges at SpaceX or Tesla.\n\n## My Perspective: Autism as a Superpower\n\nI do not view my Asperger's as a disability. I view it as a different operating system, one that has certain advantages and certain challenges compared to the neurotypical operating system that most people run.\n\nThe advantages have been enormous for my work. My ability to hyperfocus means I can learn new fields quickly and deeply. When I decided to build rockets, I read every textbook I could find on aerospace engineering. My pattern recognition abilities help me see connections between disparate fields that others might miss.\n\nThe challenges are real, though. Relationships have been difficult. I have been married three times and divorced three times. I struggle to understand emotional nuances that seem obvious to others.\n\nBut overall, I would not trade my brain for a neurotypical one. The same traits that make social situations challenging are the ones that allow me to envision a future where humanity is multiplanetary.\n\n## Common Misconceptions About Autism and Success\n\n**Misconception 1**: Having autism means you cannot be successful in business or leadership. This is demonstrably false. Many of the greatest scientists, engineers, and innovators throughout history are believed to have been on the autism spectrum.\n\n**Misconception 2**: Autistic people lack empathy. This is not accurate. What we often lack is cognitive empathy, the ability to automatically read what others are feeling. But affective empathy, actually caring about others' wellbeing, is often very strong.\n\n**Misconception 3**: Disclosing my autism was some kind of excuse for past behavior. It is not. It is simply context.\n\n## Looking Forward: Autism Awareness and Acceptance\n\nBy speaking openly about my Asperger's, I hope to contribute to greater understanding and acceptance of neurodiversity. There are millions of people on the autism spectrum, and many of them face discrimination, unemployment, and social isolation not because they lack abilities but because society is not structured to accommodate different ways of thinking.\n\nI want young people on the spectrum to know that being different is not a limitation on what you can achieve.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nSo yes, to definitively answer the question that brought you here: I have Asperger's syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum. I disclosed this publicly in May 2021, and I have been open about it since.\n\nIf you are on the spectrum yourself, I hope my story gives you some encouragement. You are not broken. You are different, and in many ways, that difference is a gift. Find the problems that fascinate you, find environments where your differences are valued rather than punished, and you may be surprised at what you can accomplish.",
