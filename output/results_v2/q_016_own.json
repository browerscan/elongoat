  "answer": "## Direct Answer: What I Actually Own\n\nLet me be crystal clear about what I own and control. I'm the CEO and largest individual shareholder of Tesla, where I own approximately 13% of the company (worth over $100 billion depending on stock price). I own roughly 42% of SpaceX, the most valuable private space company in history, valued at $180 billion as of 2024. I purchased Twitter (now X) outright for $44 billion in October 2022, making it a private company under my complete control. I also own significant stakes in several other companies I founded: Neuralink (brain-computer interfaces), The Boring Company (tunnel construction and transportation), and xAI (artificial intelligence).\n\nBeyond companies, I own multiple properties despite my stated goal of \"owning no house,\" though I've sold most of my real estate portfolio. The key distinction people need to understand: I don't just own these companies as passive investments. I'm operationally involved as CEO or executive chairman, which means I'm building them, not just holding equity.\n\n## The Full Story: How I Built This Empire\n\nMy journey to owning this portfolio didn't start with a trust fund or inheritance. It started with Zip2 in the 1990s, a company I co-founded with my brother Kimbal. When Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in 1999, I made $22 million. Most people would retire. I immediately invested $10 million into X.com, which became PayPal.\n\nWhen eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002, I was the largest shareholder and walked away with $180 million after taxes. That same year, I invested $100 million into SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla, and $10 million into SolarCity. People thought I was insane risking everything on electric cars and rockets.\n\nBy 2008, I was broke. Both Tesla and SpaceX were months from bankruptcy. I had to choose which company would get my last remaining funds. I split it between both and borrowed money to pay rent. Most people don't know how close we came to losing everything.\n\nThe Tesla IPO in 2010 changed the trajectory. As the company grew from a startup making a few hundred Roadsters to producing millions of vehicles annually, my stake became worth billions. SpaceX remained private but grew even faster, revolutionizing space travel with reusable rockets.\n\nThe Twitter acquisition in 2022 was different. I didn't found it. I bought it because I believed free speech was under threat and the platform had enormous unrealized potential. I sold Tesla shares, secured financing, and took it private. It was the largest leveraged buyout in history.\n\n## Key Details: Ownership Percentages and Valuations\n\n**Tesla (TSLA):** I own approximately 13% after selling shares to fund the Twitter acquisition and pay taxes. At Tesla's peak valuation, my stake was worth over $250 billion, making me the wealthiest person on Earth. My ownership gives me significant voting control through my position as CEO and board member. Current value fluctuates between $80-150 billion depending on stock performance.\n\n**SpaceX:** I own roughly 42% of the company and approximately 79% of voting control through a special share structure. SpaceX is valued at $180 billion as of late 2024, making my stake worth about $75 billion. Unlike Tesla, SpaceX is private, giving me more operational freedom without quarterly earnings pressure.\n\n**X (formerly Twitter):** I own 100% after taking it private. I paid $44 billion, though the company's current value is debated. Some analysts value it at $15-20 billion, while I believe the long-term value will far exceed what I paid. I've restructured it completely, cutting 80% of staff and reimagining it as an \"everything app.\"\n\n**Neuralink:** I own a significant majority stake (exact percentage undisclosed, but estimated 50-60%). The company is valued at approximately $5 billion after recent funding rounds. We're developing brain-computer interfaces that recently received FDA approval for human trials.\n\n**The Boring Company:** I own approximately 90% of the company, which is valued at $5.7 billion. We're building tunnel transportation systems, starting with Las Vegas, and developing underground infrastructure technology.\n\n**xAI:** I own a majority stake in this artificial intelligence company I founded in 2023 to compete with OpenAI. We launched Grok, an AI assistant, and raised billions in funding. Early valuation estimates put the company at $20+ billion.\n\n**Other Assets:** I've sold most real estate holdings but retain some properties for operational purposes. I've stated my primary residence is a $50,000 prefab house in Boca Chica, Texas, near SpaceX's Starbase facility.\n\n## My Perspective: Why I Build Instead of Just Buy\n\nMost billionaires diversify into stocks, bonds, hedge funds, and real estate. I do the opposite. I concentrate everything into companies I can operationally control and improve. Why? Because I'm not trying to preserve wealth—I'm trying to make humanity multiplanetary and accelerate sustainable energy.\n\nWhen I invest, I invest my time, not just money. I'm chief engineer at SpaceX, product architect at Tesla, and deeply involved in every company. The Twitter acquisition was different because I bought rather than built, but the principle remains: I'm rebuilding it from the ground up.\n\nPeople ask why I don't diversify or \"play it safe.\" The answer is simple: playing it safe doesn't change the world. When both Tesla and SpaceX were on the brink of bankruptcy in 2008, conventional wisdom said to save one and let the other die. I refused. Both companies are now worth hundreds of billions combined.\n\nI've stated publicly that I'll use my wealth to make life multiplanetary and solve Earth's energy crisis. That's not rhetoric—it's my actual investment strategy. Nearly every dollar I have is tied up in companies working toward these goals.\n\n## Common Misconceptions About What I Own\n\n**Myth 1: I still own PayPal.** Wrong. I haven't owned PayPal since eBay acquired it in 2002. I made $180 million from the sale but have zero ownership today. PayPal is a publicly traded company that I have no connection to beyond being a co-founder of its predecessor, X.com.\n\n**Myth 2: I inherited my wealth.** Completely false. My father was an engineer in South Africa, but I received no trust fund or major inheritance. I paid my way through college with loans and scholarships, worked odd jobs, and built my first company from scratch. Every dollar I have came from companies I built or invested in.\n\n**Myth 3: I own SolarCity.** Not anymore. Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 for $2.6 billion. I was a major shareholder and chairman of SolarCity (my cousins founded it with my initial investment), but it's now fully integrated into Tesla as Tesla Energy.\n\n**Myth 4: I'm the richest person because of cash.** My net worth is almost entirely tied up in stock. I have relatively little cash. When I needed $44 billion for Twitter, I had to sell Tesla shares and secure massive loans. I've said repeatedly that I have no interest in material possessions or cash hoards.\n\n**Myth 5: I own these companies to make money.** Money is a tool, not the goal. I could have retired after PayPal with $180 million. Instead, I risked everything on electric cars and rockets—both industries where startups traditionally fail. I'm building companies to solve problems, and ownership gives me the control to pursue long-term visions despite short-term losses.\n\n**Myth 6: I own Dogecoin.** I own some Dogecoin, as I've mentioned publicly, but it's not a significant part of my portfolio. I've supported Dogecoin because I think it's funny and has potential as a currency, but I'm not \"pumping\" it for profit. Tesla and SpaceX hold Bitcoin, not me personally in significant amounts.\n\n## Looking Forward: What I'm Building Next\n\nMy ownership strategy isn't about maintaining what exists—it's about building what's next. Here's where I'm focusing:\n\n**Tesla's Evolution:** Beyond cars, Tesla is becoming an AI and robotics company. We're developing Optimus (humanoid robots), full self-driving technology, and expanding energy storage. My goal is for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined because we're solving transportation and energy simultaneously.\n\n**SpaceX and Mars:** Starship is the key to making life multiplanetary. We're building a fully reusable rocket system that can carry 100+ tons to orbit for a fraction of current costs. My timeline is aggressive: I want to land humans on Mars before 2030. SpaceX's Starlink is generating revenue to fund Mars missions—that's the business model.\n\n**X as the Everything App:** Twitter was just the foundation. I'm rebuilding X to handle payments, messaging, video, shopping, and banking. Think WeChat for the West. Current valuation debates are irrelevant because I'm not selling. In 10 years, X will be the most valuable company I own—that's my prediction.\n\n**Neuralink's Medical Revolution:** We've implanted our first human patient. The goal isn't just helping paralyzed people—it's creating a high-bandwidth interface between human brains and computers. This is essential for humans to remain relevant as AI advances.\n\n**xAI's Mission:** OpenAI abandoned its mission when it partnered with Microsoft. I founded xAI to build maximally truth-seeking AI without corporate filters or censorship. Grok is just the beginning. We're training some of the largest models using custom infrastructure.\n\nI'm also considering new ventures. I've discussed buying MSNBC (jokingly, but maybe not). I'm interested in media, education, and healthcare. Wherever I see broken systems with enormous potential for improvement through technology and first-principles thinking, that's where I'll deploy capital and attention.\n\n## Final Thoughts: Ownership as Responsibility\n\nWhat I own isn't just a list of assets—it's a list of responsibilities. Every company represents thousands of employees, millions of customers, and long-term commitments to solving humanity's biggest challenges.\n\nPeople often ask if I have too much power or wealth. Here's my perspective: I could sell everything, buy an island, and live in luxury forever. Instead, I'm working 80-100 hour weeks trying to make humanity multiplanetary, transition Earth to sustainable energy, cure neurological diseases, and prevent AI from destroying civilization.\n\nThe wealth is a tool. Ownership is control. Control enables long-term thinking. Long-term thinking is how you solve problems that matter.\n\nWhen people ask what I own, the better question is: what am I building? The answer changes constantly because I'm not interested in preserving the status quo. I'm interested in creating the future.\n\nCritics say I'm overextended or reckless. They said the same thing in 2008 when I was betting everything on electric cars and rockets. They were wrong then. History will show whether they're wrong now.\n\nWhat I own today is less important than what I'm building for tomorrow. And I'm just getting started.",
