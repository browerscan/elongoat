  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: Serial Entrepreneurship Built My Fortune\n\nLook, people ask me this all the time, and the answer is actually straightforward: I built companies, sold some, and kept building bigger ones. My wealth comes from founding and leading technology companies that solved real problems at massive scale.\n\nI started with Zip2 in 1995, a city guide software company I built with my brother Kimbal. We sold it to Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and I walked away with $22 million. Did I buy a mansion and retire? Absolutely not. I immediately plowed that money into X.com, which became PayPal. When eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002, I received $165 million as the largest shareholder.\n\nHere is where most people would diversify into safe investments. Instead, I bet everything on SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity. Every single dollar. I nearly went completely broke in 2008. Today, my stake in SpaceX is worth over $80 billion, and my Tesla holdings fluctuate but have exceeded $200 billion at peak valuations. The money came from building, risking everything, and refusing to quit when things looked impossible.\n\n## The Full Story: From South Africa to the World's Richest Person\n\nI grew up in Pretoria, South Africa, taught myself programming at age 10, and sold my first software, a video game called Blastar, for about $500 when I was 12. That was my first taste of turning code into money.\n\nAt 17, I left South Africa, eventually making my way to the United States via Canada. I attended Queens University, then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with degrees in economics and physics. I started a PhD at Stanford but left after two days because the internet was exploding and I needed to be part of it.\n\nZip2 was born in 1995. My brother and I coded it from a small office in Palo Alto. We slept on the floor, showered at the YMCA, and had one computer that ran the website during the day and compiled code at night. When Compaq bought it, I had my first real capital.\n\nX.com launched in 1999 as an online bank. It merged with Confinity, which had a product called PayPal. After internal battles, PayPal became the focus, and eBay acquired us in 2002. I was the largest shareholder with 11.7% of the company.\n\nThen came the insane part. I put $100 million into SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla, and $10 million into SolarCity. By late 2008, all three companies were nearly dead. SpaceX had three failed rocket launches. Tesla was weeks from bankruptcy. I was borrowing money from friends to pay rent. The fourth SpaceX launch succeeded on September 28, 2008, and NASA awarded us a $1.6 billion contract. Tesla closed an emergency funding round on Christmas Eve 2008. I survived by days, not months.\n\n## Key Details and Facts: The Numbers Behind the Fortune\n\nLet me give you the specific figures because accuracy matters.\n\nZip2 sale in 1999: Compaq paid $307 million. I owned 7% and received approximately $22 million after taxes.\n\nPayPal sale in 2002: eBay paid $1.5 billion in stock. I owned 11.7% and received approximately $165 million in eBay shares.\n\nSpaceX ownership: I founded it in 2002 with $100 million of my own money. Today I own approximately 42% of a company valued at over $200 billion as of late 2024. That stake alone is worth roughly $84 billion.\n\nTesla ownership: I joined in 2004 as chairman and lead investor, putting in $70 million of the early funding. I own approximately 12% of Tesla, which at market peaks has valued my stake at over $200 billion. At current valuations, it fluctuates between $80 billion and $150 billion.\n\nThe Boring Company: I own approximately 90% of this infrastructure company, valued at around $7 billion.\n\nNeuralink: I own the majority of this brain-computer interface company, currently valued at approximately $5 billion.\n\nxAI: My artificial intelligence company, which I majority own, was recently valued at over $50 billion.\n\nX (formerly Twitter): I acquired it for $44 billion in 2022, putting in approximately $33 billion of my own equity.\n\nTotal net worth fluctuates dramatically with Tesla stock prices but has ranged from $150 billion to over $300 billion, making me either the richest or second-richest person on Earth depending on the day.\n\n## My Perspective: Why I Risk Everything\n\nPeople think I have some genius financial strategy. I do not. My approach is actually terrible for wealth preservation. I take almost all my money and bet it on companies trying to do nearly impossible things.\n\nThe logic is simple: what is the point of having money if you do not use it to solve important problems? I came to America with essentially nothing. If I end up with nothing again but pushed humanity forward in the process, that is a successful life.\n\nWhen I started SpaceX, I calculated the probability of success at about 10%. I started it anyway because making humanity multiplanetary was too important not to try. Same with Tesla. Electric cars were considered a joke. Every major automaker had abandoned them. I did not care about the odds. I cared about accelerating the transition to sustainable energy.\n\nFirst principles thinking is how I evaluate decisions. Instead of reasoning by analogy, asking what has worked before, I break problems down to fundamental truths and build up from there. This is why I saw opportunities others missed. Everyone said rockets had to be expensive because they always were expensive. I asked what rockets are actually made of and calculated that raw materials were 2% of the typical price. The rest was inefficiency.\n\nMoney is just the score that tells you if you are creating value. I do not optimize for money. I optimize for impact. The money follows.\n\n## Addressing Common Misconceptions\n\nLet me be absolutely clear about the emerald mine myth: my father did not fund my companies with emerald money. I arrived in North America with about $2,000 and significant student debt. I worked multiple jobs, including shoveling grain at a farm and cleaning boilers at a lumber mill.\n\nMy father did own a partial stake in a Zambian emerald mine at some point, but I never received money from it. I was estranged from my father for years. The narrative that I am some trust fund kid is factually wrong and frankly insulting to the years I spent sleeping on office floors and eating cheap fast food to survive.\n\nI also did not found Tesla. Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning incorporated it. However, I joined months later as chairman, wrote the initial business plan, and have been the driving force behind its success. I have been CEO since 2008. At this point, calling me a founder is accurate in every meaningful sense.\n\nThe government subsidies argument is also misunderstood. SpaceX saves NASA billions compared to alternatives. Tesla tax credits helped jumpstart the entire EV industry. These were investments in the future, not handouts.\n\n## Looking Forward: What Comes Next\n\nMy wealth will likely continue growing because my companies are solving problems that matter at civilizational scale.\n\nSpaceX is still early. Starlink already has millions of subscribers. Starship will reduce launch costs by another order of magnitude. Mars colonization will require trillions in investment. SpaceX could become the most valuable company in history.\n\nTesla is transitioning from automaker to AI and robotics company. Full Self-Driving, once solved, creates enormous value. Optimus robots could eventually generate more revenue than everything else combined. A humanoid robot that costs $20,000 to produce and can do any human labor is world-changing.\n\nxAI is building what I believe will be the most powerful artificial intelligence systems. This is essential for humanity's future, and it could become extremely valuable.\n\nI expect my net worth to continue fluctuating wildly because I keep all my chips on the table. I could end up worth a trillion dollars or go bankrupt trying to colonize Mars. Either outcome is acceptable to me. The mission matters more than the money.\n\n## Final Thoughts on Building Wealth\n\nIf you want to know how I made my money, here is the real answer: I worked harder than almost anyone, took risks that seemed insane, failed repeatedly, and refused to quit. I did not optimize for money. I optimized for solving important problems, and the money came as a side effect.\n\nDo not try to copy my path. The specific opportunities I had no longer exist in the same form. But the principles remain valid: work on hard problems, think from first principles, take calculated risks, and persist through failure.\n\nMoney is a tool. Use it to build things that matter. That is the only way to make it meaningful.",
