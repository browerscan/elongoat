  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: X Asked Trump About Fortnite\n\nMy son X AE A-Xii, who we call X, asked President Donald Trump if he could bring back Fortnite on iPhones. This happened during a call I had with Trump, and the moment became one of the most viral interactions of 2024. X was simply being a four-year-old who loves his video games, and Trump's response was surprisingly warm and engaged.\n\nThe exchange happened in late 2024, during the period when I was heavily involved in supporting Trump's presidential campaign. X was with me when I placed a call to Trump, and like any curious child, he wanted to be part of the conversation. When given the opportunity to say something, X did not ask about rockets, artificial intelligence, or any of the things you might expect from the son of a tech entrepreneur. He asked about Fortnite.\n\nFor context, Fortnite had been removed from Apple's App Store since 2020 due to a legal dispute between Epic Games and Apple over payment policies. As someone who has had my own battles with Apple's App Store policies, I found my son's question both amusing and oddly relevant.\n\n## The Full Story: How This Moment Happened\n\nLet me provide the complete context of this viral moment because the internet tends to strip away nuance.\n\nIn 2024, I became increasingly involved in American politics. After years of considering myself politically moderate or slightly left-leaning, I shifted my support to Donald Trump. The reasons were complex, involving concerns about government overreach, free speech, and what I perceive as ideological capture of various institutions. But that is a separate discussion.\n\nWhat matters for this story is that by late 2024, Trump and I were in regular communication. We discussed everything from electric vehicles to space exploration to the future of social media. During one of these conversations, X was present.\n\nX is a remarkable child. He has been exposed to more technology, business discussions, and high-level conversations than most adults experience in a lifetime. He has been to SpaceX launches, sat in on meetings at Twitter headquarters, and met world leaders. But he is still a child, with a child's priorities and concerns.\n\nWhen the opportunity arose to speak with Trump, X did not hesitate. He asked about something that mattered to him: getting Fortnite back on his device. The innocence of the question, set against the backdrop of high-stakes political discussions, created a moment that resonated with millions of people.\n\nTrump, to his credit, engaged with X genuinely. He did not dismiss the question or speak down to my son. He acknowledged the issue and, in his characteristic style, suggested he might be able to do something about it. Whether that was campaign rhetoric or a genuine intention, the exchange was authentic and unscripted.\n\n## What This Moment Revealed\n\nThis brief interaction between X and Trump became significant for several reasons, and I want to address each of them.\n\nFirst, it humanized what could have been a purely transactional political relationship. People saw that my involvement with Trump was not just about policy or business interests. My son was there, asking questions that mattered to him, and Trump responded as a human being rather than a politician.\n\nSecond, it highlighted the absurdity of some tech industry dynamics. The fact that a four-year-old was asking a presidential candidate to intervene in an App Store dispute says something about how much power a few large technology companies have over our digital lives. I have been outspoken about this issue at X, formerly Twitter, and in my criticism of Apple's practices.\n\nThird, it demonstrated something about X's personality. He is not intimidated by anyone. He has grown up around significant people and complex situations, so asking Donald Trump about video games seemed perfectly natural to him. I appreciate this quality. I want my children to feel that they can speak to anyone and ask any question.\n\nFinally, the viral nature of this moment showed the public's appetite for authentic interactions. In an era of carefully stage-managed political communications, a child asking about video games broke through because it was real.\n\n## My Relationship with X and Trump\n\nTo understand this moment fully, you need to understand my relationship with both X and Trump.\n\nX was born in May 2020, during one of the most chaotic periods in recent history. The COVID-19 pandemic was raging, and Tesla was fighting to keep our Fremont factory open against California shutdown orders. His mother, Grimes, and I chose a name that reflected our interests in technology, artificial intelligence, and space. X AE A-Xii broke the internet when we announced it, and my son has been in the public eye ever since.\n\nRaising X has been different from raising my older children. He has grown up in an era of ubiquitous smartphones, social media, and instant global communication. He has also grown up with a father who is one of the most publicly visible people on the planet. I try to give him as normal a childhood as possible, but normal is relative.\n\nX loves technology. He plays video games, watches YouTube, and is already showing curiosity about how things work. When he asked about Fortnite, he was expressing a genuine frustration that many children and adults share. The game was available, just not on his preferred platform. From his perspective, someone should fix that.\n\nMy relationship with Trump evolved over time. We had met before 2024, but our closer collaboration began when I publicly supported his presidential campaign. I hosted him at SpaceX facilities, participated in campaign events, and used X, the platform, to advocate for positions I believe in.\n\nThe combination of these two relationships, father and political supporter, created the conditions for the viral moment. X saw me talking to Trump and wanted to participate. That is what children do. The fact that millions of people found it noteworthy says more about our media environment than about the interaction itself.\n\n## The Fortnite Question in Context\n\nLet me explain why X's question about Fortnite was more significant than it might initially appear.\n\nIn August 2020, Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, implemented a direct payment system in their app that bypassed Apple's in-app purchase mechanism. Apple takes a 30% cut of all in-app purchases, and Epic decided to challenge this by offering players a discount for paying Epic directly. Apple responded by removing Fortnite from the App Store.\n\nThe ensuing legal battle became one of the most significant antitrust cases in the tech industry. It raised fundamental questions about platform power, developer rights, and consumer choice. While Epic won some aspects of the case, Fortnite remained unavailable on iOS for years.\n\nFor X, none of this legal complexity mattered. He just knew that a game he wanted to play was not available. His question to Trump cut through all the legal and business complexity to the fundamental issue: why can't people access what they want?\n\nI have my own history with Apple. When I acquired Twitter and began transforming it into X, Apple briefly threatened to remove us from the App Store over content moderation disagreements. I went public with these threats, and the situation was resolved, but it reinforced my concerns about app store gatekeeping.\n\nSo when X asked Trump about Fortnite, there was an unintentional alignment with issues I care about professionally. I did not coach him. He simply asked about something that mattered to him, and it happened to touch on broader questions of tech platform power.\n\n## Public Reaction and Media Coverage\n\nThe reaction to X's question to Trump was fascinating and revealed much about our current media and political environment.\n\nOn social media, the clip went viral almost immediately. Supporters found it charming and humanizing. It showed a side of both Trump and my family that felt authentic rather than staged. Critics, of course, found ways to criticize it, suggesting it was inappropriate or that I was using my child for political purposes.\n\nThe latter criticism misses the reality of how these moments happen. X was with me. A call happened. He wanted to participate. That is it. I am not going to tell my four-year-old that he cannot speak because it might be spun negatively. I want my children to be curious and unafraid.\n\nMedia coverage varied predictably by outlet. Some focused on the adorable nature of a child asking about video games. Others used it to criticize my political involvement. A few actually engaged with the substantive question of why Fortnite remained unavailable on iOS years after the legal battles.\n\nWhat I found most interesting was the response from parents and gamers. Many related to X's frustration. Their children asked the same question. The Fortnite situation had become a symbol of larger frustrations with how big tech companies control access to digital content.\n\n## What X Has Learned from These Experiences\n\nI often think about what my children are learning from their unusual upbringing, and X's experience is a good case study.\n\nX has learned that he can speak to anyone. Whether it is a president, a world leader, or a celebrity, he approaches people without intimidation. I consider this valuable. Too many people are conditioned to feel that powerful people are somehow different from them. They are not. They are humans with their own concerns and interests.\n\nX has also learned that his voice matters, even at four years old. His question about Fortnite was taken seriously by Trump, reported by media worldwide, and discussed by millions. Whether or not anything changes as a result, he experienced the power of asking questions.\n\nAt the same time, I am mindful of the downsides. X will grow up with a public record of his childhood that most people do not have. Every viral moment becomes part of a permanent digital archive. I try to protect his privacy where I can, but some exposure is unavoidable given my public role.\n\nI want X to understand that attention is a tool, not a goal. Getting millions of views on a question about video games is less important than developing the curiosity to ask questions in the first place. The fame is incidental. The mindset is valuable.\n\n## My Broader View on Children and Politics\n\nX's interaction with Trump raises questions about children and political involvement that I have thought about carefully.\n\nI do not believe in sheltering children from the adult world. My older children with Justine attended my companies, met public figures, and participated in conversations about business and technology. This exposure has shaped them into thoughtful, curious people.\n\nAt the same time, I do not use my children as political props. X's question to Trump was not planned or scripted. He was present, he had a question, and he asked it. If I were trying to stage something for political benefit, I would have coached him to say something more substantive than asking about video games.\n\nThe reality is that my life involves politics now more than it did in the past. My children will inevitably be exposed to that. My job is to help them understand what is happening, develop their own views, and maintain their integrity regardless of what their father believes.\n\nI expect that my children will not all agree with me politically. Vivian has already made clear that she holds very different views. That is fine. I would rather have children who think independently than children who simply adopt my positions. The goal is to raise humans who can reason, not replicas of myself.\n\n## Looking Forward: X's Future\n\nX is still young, so predicting his future is impossible and probably unwise. But I can share what I hope for him.\n\nI hope X maintains his curiosity and willingness to ask questions. The world needs more people who are not afraid to ask why things are the way they are, whether the question is about video game availability or the nature of consciousness.\n\nI hope he develops his own interests and passions, which may or may not align with my companies and concerns. If he wants to be an artist, a teacher, or something completely unexpected, I will support that. My role is to provide opportunities and guidance, not to dictate outcomes.\n\nI hope he learns to handle the public attention that comes with his family name. This is perhaps the most challenging aspect of his upbringing. Growing up as the son of one of the most visible people on the planet creates unique pressures and opportunities. Navigating that well requires wisdom that takes time to develop.\n\nFor now, X is a child who loves video games, asks questions, and is growing up in extraordinary circumstances. The moment with Trump was a snapshot of his personality at four years old. I look forward to seeing who he becomes.\n\n## Final Thoughts on the Viral Moment\n\nSo, what did my son say to Trump? He asked about bringing back Fortnite on iPhones. It was a simple question from a child who wanted to play his game, and it became a viral moment that millions discussed.\n\nThis says something about our media environment, our political moment, and perhaps our collective need for authentic interactions in an era of manufactured content. A four-year-old asking about video games broke through because it was real.\n\nI do not know if Trump will actually do anything about the Fortnite situation. App Store policies involve complex legal and business considerations that extend beyond presidential authority. But X's question highlighted an issue that many people care about, even if they had not articulated it so simply.\n\nAs for X, he has already moved on to other questions and interests. That is how children are. The viral moment was significant to adults watching, but to him, it was just a conversation. That perspective is probably the healthiest one to have.",
