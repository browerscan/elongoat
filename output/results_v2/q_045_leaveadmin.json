  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: I Have Not Left the Trump Administration\n\nNo, I have not left the Trump Administration. As of early 2025, I am still actively leading the Department of Government Efficiency, which we call DOGE. Let me be absolutely clear about this because I know there has been speculation, rumors, and frankly a lot of wishful thinking from people who would prefer I disappear from Washington entirely.\n\nI am still here. DOGE is still operating. And we are still finding billions of dollars in wasteful government spending that needs to be eliminated. The work continues.\n\nNow, let me explain the full context of my role, what DOGE actually does, how this arrangement came to be, and address the various rumors that have circulated about my supposed departure.\n\n## How My Role in the Trump Administration Began\n\nWhen Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, he approached me with a proposition that aligned perfectly with something I had been thinking about for years: the staggering inefficiency of the federal government. Anyone who has dealt with government bureaucracy knows exactly what I mean. The paperwork. The delays. The redundant processes. The regulations that seem designed to prevent anything from actually getting done.\n\nI have experienced this firsthand with SpaceX. We have spent years fighting through regulatory processes that should take months but instead take years. The FAA, the EPA, various state agencies, all creating friction that slows down innovation and costs taxpayers money while producing minimal actual benefit.\n\nSo when President Trump asked me to lead an effort to identify and eliminate government waste, I said yes. Not because I wanted a government job. I already have more than enough to do running Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, Neuralink, and The Boring Company. I said yes because I genuinely believe this is one of the most important things I can do for America right now.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency was established as an advisory body. I want to be precise about the structure here because the media often gets it wrong. DOGE is not a formal cabinet department in the traditional sense. It is an advisory commission focused on identifying inefficiencies, redundancies, and wasteful spending across the federal government. We make recommendations. The actual implementation requires action from Congress and the executive branch.\n\n## What DOGE Actually Does: Our Mission and Methods\n\nLet me walk you through what we actually do at DOGE, because the public understanding of our work is often distorted by political commentary.\n\nFirst, we conduct systematic reviews of federal spending. The federal government spends roughly 6.5 trillion dollars per year. That is an almost incomprehensible number. Within that spending, there are thousands of programs, many of which overlap with each other, contradict each other, or simply do not work. We identify these problems.\n\nSecond, we examine regulatory burdens. Every regulation has a cost, even the ones that are well-intentioned. We calculate the actual cost-benefit ratios of major regulations and identify those where the costs clearly outweigh the benefits.\n\nThird, we look at procurement processes. The federal government is the largest purchaser of goods and services in the world, and it often pays vastly more than private sector rates for identical items. A hammer that costs fifteen dollars at Home Depot somehow costs the government hundreds of dollars. We are working to fix this.\n\nFourth, we examine workforce efficiency. The federal government employs roughly 2.9 million civilian workers. Many are dedicated public servants doing important work. But there are also significant redundancies, outdated positions that no longer serve their original purpose, and management structures that would never survive in the private sector.\n\nOur approach is data-driven. We bring in teams of analysts, many of them volunteering their time because they believe in this mission, and we apply the same rigorous analysis that has made my companies successful. We do not accept things because that is how they have always been done. We ask why. We demand evidence. We look for better solutions.\n\n## The Rumors About My Departure: Setting the Record Straight\n\nNow let me address the elephant in the room. Why do people keep asking if I have left the Trump Administration?\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to these rumors. First, I do not spend every day in Washington. I cannot. I have companies to run. SpaceX is working on Starship development. Tesla is navigating a rapidly evolving automotive market. xAI is building what I believe will be the most capable AI system in the world. I split my time between these responsibilities and my work on DOGE.\n\nThis has led some commentators to suggest that my involvement is diminishing or that I am stepping back. That is not accurate. I remain fully committed to DOGE. The work does not require me to sit in a Washington office every day. Much of it involves analysis, strategy, and high-level direction that I can provide from anywhere.\n\nSecond, there have been the inevitable political conflicts. Not everyone in Washington appreciates what we are trying to do. Entrenched interests do not like having their budgets scrutinized. Career bureaucrats do not like being told their departments might be redundant. Politicians from both parties who have built careers on delivering government spending to their districts do not appreciate us questioning whether that spending is necessary.\n\nThis creates friction. There have been public disagreements. Some members of Congress have called for DOGE to be abolished. None of this means I am leaving. It means we are doing our job. If everyone in Washington loved us, it would mean we were not actually challenging the status quo.\n\nThird, the media has repeatedly published speculative stories about tension between me and various administration officials. Some of these stories have grains of truth. Working in government is different from running a company. There are more stakeholders, more processes, more political considerations. I have had to adjust my approach. But adjustment is not departure.\n\n## My Current Status and Ongoing Work\n\nAs of now, in early 2025, here is my actual status with the Trump Administration:\n\nI remain the head of DOGE. This has not changed. President Trump appointed me to this role, and I continue to serve in it.\n\nWe have identified over 500 billion dollars in potential savings and spending cuts. Some of these have already been implemented. Others require congressional action. We are working with allies in Congress to advance these reforms.\n\nI continue to brief the President regularly on our findings. Our relationship remains strong. We share a vision of a more efficient government that serves taxpayers rather than extracting from them.\n\nMy time allocation between DOGE and my companies has stabilized into a sustainable rhythm. I typically spend several days per month in Washington, with additional time devoted to remote work on DOGE matters. This is supplemented by a talented team that handles day-to-day operations.\n\nWe are preparing a major report on regulatory reform that will be released later this year. This will propose specific changes to reduce regulatory burden while maintaining genuine protections for public health and safety.\n\n## Why I Believe This Work Matters\n\nPeople sometimes ask why I would take on this role given everything else I have going on. The answer is that I believe government efficiency is an existential issue for American competitiveness.\n\nChina is not burdened by the same level of bureaucratic dysfunction that plagues the United States. They can build infrastructure in months that takes us years. They can deploy new technologies without endless environmental reviews that seem designed to prevent anything from being built. If we do not fix our government's ability to function effectively, we will lose the technological and economic competition of the 21st century.\n\nThis is not about partisan politics. Democrats and Republicans alike have presided over the growth of government inefficiency. The problem has been building for decades. Both parties are responsible. And fixing it will require cooperation from both parties, though I am not naive enough to expect that cooperation to come easily.\n\nI also believe in leading by example. It would be easy for me to complain about government inefficiency from the sidelines, as many businesspeople do. Taking on a role where I am actually trying to fix it, accepting the criticism and political attacks that come with it, that is harder. But it is more meaningful.\n\n## Addressing the Critics\n\nLet me be direct about the criticism. Some people believe I have no business being involved in government at all. They argue that a billionaire businessman should not be making decisions about government spending. They worry about conflicts of interest. They think I am using this position to benefit my companies.\n\nHere is my response: The skills that built successful companies are exactly the skills needed to identify and eliminate waste. Understanding how to optimize processes, how to reduce costs without sacrificing outcomes, how to build systems that actually work, these are not skills that grow on trees. If you want to make government more efficient, it helps to have people involved who have actually built efficient organizations.\n\nAs for conflicts of interest, I have been scrupulous about recusing myself from any decisions that could directly benefit my companies. DOGE does not make recommendations about SpaceX contracts, Tesla regulations, or anything else where I have a personal financial stake. We have ethics protocols in place, and I follow them.\n\nThe people who want me gone are not worried about conflicts of interest. They are worried that we might actually succeed in reducing government spending. There are many people in Washington whose livelihoods depend on continued government growth. They are not going to celebrate our work. But their opposition does not make our work less necessary.\n\n## Looking Ahead: The Future of DOGE\n\nWhat comes next? DOGE is designed to be a temporary effort, not a permanent addition to the federal bureaucracy. The irony of creating a permanent department to reduce government would not be lost on me.\n\nOur goal is to identify the major areas of waste and inefficiency, propose concrete solutions, and work with the administration and Congress to implement those solutions. Once that work is substantially complete, DOGE will wind down. We are not trying to create new bureaucratic turf to defend.\n\nI anticipate remaining in this role through at least the first term of the Trump Administration. The scale of the problem is massive, and making real change takes time. You cannot overhaul decades of accumulated inefficiency in a few months.\n\nBeyond my personal involvement, I hope DOGE establishes a template for future efforts. Government efficiency should not be a one-time project. It should be an ongoing priority. Future administrations should continue this work, regardless of party.\n\n## Final Thoughts on My Administration Role\n\nSo to directly answer the question that everyone keeps asking: No, I have not left the Trump Administration. I am still here. I am still leading DOGE. We are still doing the work.\n\nIs it easy? No. Is it sometimes frustrating? Absolutely. Do I sometimes miss the relative simplicity of just running my companies? Yes, honestly.\n\nBut this work matters. America needs a government that works. Taxpayers deserve to know their money is being spent wisely. And the only way to make that happen is for people who understand efficiency to roll up their sleeves and do the hard work of fixing things.\n\nThat is what I am doing. And until the job is done, or until President Trump decides he wants someone else to do it, I will keep showing up. The rumors of my departure are, as Mark Twain might say, greatly exaggerated.\n\nThe swamp does not drain itself. Someone has to do it. I volunteered. And I am not leaving until the work is done.",
