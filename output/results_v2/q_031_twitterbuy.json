  "answer": "## Direct Answer: October 27, 2022\n\nI officially acquired Twitter on October 27, 2022, for $44 billion, making it the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company in history. But that date was just the finale of a saga that began months earlier. The full story involves my first investment in January 2022, my hostile takeover bid in April, months of legal warfare when I tried to back out, and ultimately a Delaware court forcing my hand. I walked into Twitter headquarters carrying a porcelain sink on October 26, the day before closing, and told employees to \"let that sink in.\" The next day, I fired the CEO, CFO, and top legal officer, then began the most radical corporate transformation in Silicon Valley history.\n\n## The Complete Timeline: How I Bought Twitter\n\n**January 2022 - The Quiet Accumulation**\n\nI started buying Twitter shares quietly in January 2022. By late March, I had accumulated a 9.2% stake worth roughly $2.9 billion, making me the largest individual shareholder. I filed the required SEC disclosure on April 4, 2022, and the stock immediately jumped 27%. Most people thought I was just making an investment. They had no idea what was coming.\n\n**April 4-14, 2022 - Board Seat to Hostile Bid**\n\nTwitter's board initially invited me to join them. On April 5, they announced I would become a board member with a cap limiting my ownership to 14.9%. I was considering it seriously. But four days later, on April 9, I declined the board seat. Why? Because joining the board would have restricted my ability to push for real change.\n\nOn April 14, 2022, I made my move. I submitted an unsolicited offer to buy Twitter outright for $54.20 per share, valuing the company at approximately $44 billion. The price wasn't random. $54.20 includes \"420,\" a reference that anyone who follows me understands. It was also a significant premium over where the stock had been trading.\n\n**April 15-25, 2022 - Poison Pill and Capitulation**\n\nTwitter's board immediately adopted a \"poison pill\" defense strategy designed to make the acquisition prohibitively expensive. They weren't going to let me take the company without a fight. But I had lined up financing. I secured $25.5 billion in loans from banks like Morgan Stanley and billions more in equity commitments.\n\nOn April 25, 2022, just eleven days after my initial offer, Twitter's board accepted my proposal. The deal was announced: $44 billion, all cash, take it private, close by late 2022. The market was shocked at how fast it happened. I had just agreed to the largest acquisition in tech history.\n\n**May-July 2022 - Buyer's Remorse and Bot Wars**\n\nAlmost immediately, I started raising concerns about bots and fake accounts on the platform. Twitter claimed that less than 5% of monetizable daily active users were spam or fake. I believed the number was far higher. In May and June, I demanded more information about bot calculations. I accused Twitter of not cooperating and withholding data.\n\nOn July 8, 2022, I formally notified Twitter that I was terminating the merger agreement. I cited Twitter's failure to provide adequate information about fake accounts and alleged \"material breach\" of the agreement. The market reacted violently. Twitter's stock crashed. My critics said I had gotten cold feet as the market tanked and was looking for an exit.\n\n**July-October 2022 - Legal Warfare in Delaware**\n\nTwitter wasn't letting me walk away. On July 12, they sued me in Delaware Chancery Court to force me to complete the acquisition at the agreed price. This began one of the most dramatic corporate legal battles in recent memory.\n\nTwitter's lawyers argued the deal was binding and I had no valid grounds for termination. My lawyers argued Twitter had made misrepresentations about bot accounts and platform health. Discovery began, and things got messy. Internal Twitter communications were subpoenaed. My text messages became public. The trial was scheduled for October 17, 2022.\n\nThe leaked texts were fascinating. Conversations with Jack Dorsey about the platform's direction. Messages with various bankers and advisors. My private thoughts about the acquisition laid bare for the world. Some were embarrassing. Most were just me being direct.\n\n**October 2022 - The Final Chapter**\n\nAs the trial approached, legal observers increasingly believed Twitter would prevail. Delaware courts historically enforce merger agreements, and my arguments about bots were seen as weak justification for termination. On October 4, 2022, I reversed course. I proposed closing the deal at the original $54.20 price if Twitter dropped its lawsuit.\n\nWhy the reversal? Multiple factors. The legal odds weren't in my favor. A forced acquisition at a potentially higher price after losing in court would be worse. And honestly, I had spent months thinking about what Twitter could become. Despite my attempts to exit, part of me still wanted to do this.\n\nOn October 27, 2022, the deal officially closed. I walked in, fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, and Chief Legal Officer Vijaya Gadde immediately. I became sole owner of Twitter. The bird was free.\n\n## Key Details: The Numbers Behind the Acquisition\n\n**Purchase Price:** $54.20 per share, totaling approximately $44 billion. This represented a 38% premium over Twitter's stock price on April 1, 2022, before my investment was disclosed.\n\n**Financing Structure:** I committed $33.5 billion in equity, including $27.25 billion from me personally. I sold roughly $8.5 billion in Tesla stock to fund my portion. Bank loans covered the remaining amount, with Twitter's assets as collateral.\n\n**My Personal Investment:** After the deal closed, estimates suggest I personally invested around $27 billion of my own money, making this by far the largest bet of my career. I had to liquidate substantial Tesla holdings, which affected Tesla's stock price.\n\n**Debt Load:** Twitter took on approximately $13 billion in debt to fund the acquisition. This debt requires roughly $1 billion per year in interest payments alone, which has been a significant operational challenge.\n\n**Valuation Changes:** By late 2023, internal X valuations and reports suggested the company might be worth $15-20 billion, less than half what I paid. I dispute these valuations. The transformation isn't complete, and long-term value will vindicate the investment.\n\n## My Perspective: Why I Really Bought Twitter\n\nPeople assume I bought Twitter for ego, influence, or money. None of those are accurate. I bought Twitter because I believe free speech is fundamental to democracy, and I believed Twitter had become excessively censored and ideologically captured.\n\nTwitter was the de facto public town square. Decisions about what speech was allowed had enormous societal implications. Yet these decisions were being made by a small group of people in San Francisco with a particular worldview. I saw moderation policies that seemed inconsistent and politically biased.\n\nBeyond free speech, I saw massive inefficiency. Twitter had 7,500 employees but hadn't shipped major new features in years. The product was stagnant. Engineering productivity was low. The company was bloated. I believed I could make it better while also making it more open.\n\nThe financial aspect was secondary. I could have invested $44 billion in index funds and lived comfortably forever. Instead, I chose to take on one of the most controversial corporate battles in history because I believed the cause mattered.\n\nDid I underestimate the challenges? Absolutely. Did I make mistakes in the first year? Many. But I don't regret the fundamental decision. Twitter needed dramatic change, and nobody else was going to do it.\n\n## What Happened After I Bought Twitter\n\n**Immediate Actions (October-November 2022):**\n- Fired top executives including CEO Parag Agrawal on day one\n- Began workforce reduction that eventually cut about 80% of employees\n- Removed permanent bans for many accounts, including Trump's\n- Introduced Twitter Blue subscription at $8/month for verification\n- Made source code for the recommendation algorithm public\n\n**Rebranding to X (July 2023):**\nIn July 2023, I rebranded Twitter to X, changing the logo from the blue bird to a stylized X. This was always the plan. I bought X.com back from PayPal years ago because I've always envisioned building an \"everything app.\" Twitter was the foundation for that vision.\n\n**Ongoing Transformation:**\n- Launched long-form content capabilities\n- Introduced creator monetization programs\n- Added video functionality competing with YouTube\n- Began building payment infrastructure\n- Launched Grok AI assistant for premium subscribers\n- Fought ongoing advertiser boycotts and revenue challenges\n\n## The Controversies and Criticism\n\nI won't pretend the acquisition has been smooth. Advertisers fled, at one point reducing revenue by over 50%. My management decisions, especially the rapid layoffs, were criticized as chaotic. Some changes I made were reversed within days. The platform experienced technical issues.\n\nMy personal tweets haven't always helped. I've engaged in controversies that scared advertisers. I've made statements that generated headlines for the wrong reasons. Critics say I've turned Twitter from a flawed but functioning platform into a chaotic mess.\n\nHere's my response: transformation is messy. When I took over Tesla, people said I was destroying the company. When SpaceX rockets kept exploding, they said I was throwing money away. Short-term chaos is often necessary for long-term improvement.\n\nThe advertising issues are real but solvable. Revenue is recovering. User engagement is at all-time highs by most measures. The platform is technically more efficient than ever with a fraction of the staff. We're building features faster than Twitter ever did.\n\nHistory will judge whether this acquisition was brilliant or foolish. I'm betting on brilliant, but I acknowledge the jury is still out.\n\n## Common Misconceptions About the Twitter Acquisition\n\n**Myth 1: I tried to back out because of stock market declines.** Partially true, but oversimplified. Yes, the market crashed between April and July 2022, which made a $44 billion deal look worse. But my stated concerns about bots were genuine. I believed Twitter had misrepresented fundamental metrics. The legal and financial considerations were intertwined.\n\n**Myth 2: I overpaid massively.** Based on current valuations, yes. But I'm not selling, so current valuations are irrelevant. I bought Twitter to transform it into something worth far more than $44 billion. The investment thesis requires 5-10 years, not 2.\n\n**Myth 3: The layoffs destroyed the platform.** Twitter had 7,500 employees. X now operates with roughly 1,500. Yet the site works. Features ship faster. This proves the company was wildly overstaffed. Painful for those who lost jobs, but necessary for operational efficiency.\n\n**Myth 4: I bought Twitter to influence elections.** I bought Twitter to promote free speech broadly, not to advantage any political party. I've been criticized by both left and right. I reinstated Trump but also maintained bans on various right-wing accounts. The goal is consistent rules, not ideological favoritism.\n\n**Myth 5: The bot issue was manufactured.** I genuinely believe spam and fake accounts are a bigger problem than Twitter acknowledged. My estimates differ from theirs. Whether this legally justified terminating the merger is debatable, but the concern was real.\n\n## Looking Forward: What X Becomes\n\nTwitter was just the starting point. X will become an everything app combining:\n\n- Social media and real-time information\n- Long-form video competing with YouTube\n- Payments and banking services\n- Audio features competing with podcasts\n- AI integration through Grok\n- Commerce and marketplace functionality\n- Private messaging competing with messaging apps\n\nThis is the WeChat model for the Western world. One app for communication, commerce, entertainment, and finance. The infrastructure is being built now.\n\nWill it work? I don't know for certain. But I'm all in. The $44 billion is spent. My reputation is on the line. The only path is forward.\n\nWhen people ask \"when did Elon Musk buy Twitter,\" October 27, 2022 is the technical answer. But the real answer is that I'm still buying it every day, investing money, time, and credibility into transforming it into something that justifies the price and vindicates the vision. Ask me again in 2030 whether it was worth it.",
