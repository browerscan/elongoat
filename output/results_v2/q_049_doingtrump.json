  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: Leading the Department of Government Efficiency\n\nI am leading the Department of Government Efficiency, which we call DOGE. President Trump appointed me to this position after his 2024 election victory, and my mission is straightforward: cut wasteful federal spending, eliminate unnecessary regulations, and modernize how the United States government operates. This is not a cabinet position in the traditional sense. DOGE operates as an advisory body focused on identifying and eliminating government waste, with the goal of making the federal bureaucracy dramatically more efficient.\n\nLet me be clear about why I took this on. The federal government currently spends approximately $6.5 trillion per year. A significant portion of that spending is wasteful, duplicative, or funds programs that no longer serve their intended purpose. Someone needed to bring private sector efficiency to Washington. I volunteered because I believe this is one of the most impactful things anyone can do for America right now.\n\n## The Genesis of DOGE: How This Came Together\n\nThe story of my involvement with President Trump's administration starts well before the 2024 election. I endorsed Trump in July 2024, shortly after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. That moment crystallized something for me. I saw a leader who was willing to take bullets for his vision of America, and I knew I needed to support that kind of courage.\n\nThroughout the campaign, I became increasingly involved. I contributed significantly to America PAC, a political action committee focused on voter registration and turnout in swing states. I appeared at rallies. I used my platform on X to advocate for policies I believed would benefit the country. When Trump won, he asked me to take on something bigger.\n\nThe concept of DOGE emerged from conversations about what was fundamentally broken in Washington. The name is a nod to my favorite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin, but the mission is deadly serious. I am working alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, who brings his own experience as an entrepreneur and his deep understanding of regulatory capture. Together, we are building a team of the sharpest minds from the private sector to audit and reform federal operations.\n\n## What DOGE Actually Does: The Specifics\n\nLet me walk you through exactly what we are doing, because there is a lot of speculation and misinformation out there.\n\n**Spending Analysis and Cuts**\n\nThe federal government has never been audited properly. Trillions of dollars flow through agencies with minimal accountability. DOGE is conducting the most comprehensive review of federal spending in American history. We are identifying programs that overlap, contracts that are overpriced, and entire departments that could be consolidated or eliminated.\n\nOur initial target is cutting at least $2 trillion in federal spending. Some people say this is impossible. I say it is conservative. When you actually look at the waste, the number becomes obvious. Defense contractors charging $500 for hammers. Multiple agencies doing the same job. Programs created decades ago that nobody has reviewed since. The opportunities are everywhere.\n\n**Regulatory Reform**\n\nRegulations cost the American economy an estimated $2 trillion annually in compliance costs. Many of these regulations were written by bureaucrats who have never run a business, never met a payroll, never had to balance efficiency against mandates. DOGE is reviewing regulations across every agency with a simple test: Does this regulation create more value than it costs? If not, it goes.\n\nI have experience with this at my own companies. At Tesla, we have dealt with regulatory frameworks designed for a different era. At SpaceX, we have had to navigate FAA approval processes that were written before reusable rockets existed. I understand how regulations can stifle innovation while providing minimal actual benefit.\n\n**Technology Modernization**\n\nThe federal government runs on technology that would embarrass a startup from 2005. We are talking about systems that still use COBOL, databases that do not communicate with each other, and cybersecurity practices that leave America vulnerable. DOGE is prioritizing technological modernization because it underpins everything else. You cannot have an efficient government running on inefficient technology.\n\n**Workforce Optimization**\n\nThe federal workforce has grown consistently for decades, regardless of actual need. DOGE is analyzing where headcount has expanded without corresponding improvements in output. We are not looking to fire good public servants. We are looking to identify positions that exist because of bureaucratic inertia rather than genuine necessity. Early retirement packages, hiring freezes, and attrition can accomplish a lot without dramatic layoffs.\n\n## My Specific Responsibilities and Authority\n\nI want to address some confusion about my role. I am not a cabinet secretary. I do not have direct statutory authority to cut spending or eliminate regulations. That power rests with Congress and the executive agencies. What I do have is the ear of the President, a mandate to identify problems, and the platform to make those problems visible to the American public.\n\nMy approach is data-driven. We are building dashboards that show exactly where money goes and what outcomes it produces. We are publishing reports that name specific programs and explain why they should be reformed or eliminated. Transparency is our weapon against bureaucratic resistance.\n\nI am personally involved in the highest-priority items. I meet regularly with agency heads, sometimes productively and sometimes less so. Not everyone in Washington is enthusiastic about efficiency. Some people have built careers on expanding government, and they see DOGE as a threat. They are right to.\n\n## The Challenges We Face\n\nLet me be honest about the obstacles, because pretending this is easy would be dishonest.\n\n**Bureaucratic Resistance**\n\nWashington is designed to resist change. The permanent bureaucracy has survived multiple administrations, and many career officials see political appointees as temporary inconveniences to be waited out. DOGE faces this resistance every day. We are asking people to identify inefficiencies in their own departments, which is like asking turkeys to vote for Thanksgiving.\n\n**Legal Constraints**\n\nMany spending programs are mandated by law. We cannot simply eliminate Social Security or Medicare through executive action. What we can do is identify reforms that would require congressional action and build public support for those reforms. The Impoundment Control Act limits executive authority to withhold appropriated funds, though there are legitimate debates about its constitutionality.\n\n**Time Pressure**\n\nI have committed to this role through July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of American independence. That gives us roughly 18 months to make as much impact as possible. Government moves slowly. We are trying to move at startup speed within a system designed for glacial pace. It is challenging but not impossible.\n\n**Political Opposition**\n\nDemocrats and some establishment Republicans oppose what we are doing. They call it reckless, authoritarian, or a conflict of interest because my companies do business with the government. I address the conflict of interest concern head-on: I have recused myself from any decisions involving my companies. This is about making government work for regular Americans, not about benefiting Elon Musk.\n\n## Early Wins and Progress\n\nDespite the challenges, we are making progress. Let me share some early wins.\n\nWe identified over $500 million in duplicate software contracts across agencies. Different departments were paying for the same services multiple times. We consolidated those contracts and negotiated better rates.\n\nWe flagged numerous programs for elimination that had not been reauthorized by Congress but were still receiving funding through continuing resolutions. Some of these programs had not been reviewed in decades.\n\nWe accelerated the implementation of artificial intelligence tools for fraud detection. The federal government loses an estimated $200 billion or more annually to fraud and improper payments. Better detection pays for itself many times over.\n\nWe proposed structural reforms to the federal hiring process, which currently takes an average of 98 days and drives away talented candidates who have private sector options. Good people will not wait three months for a job offer.\n\n## Why I Am Doing This\n\nPeople ask me constantly: Why would a man running multiple companies take on a government role that pays nothing and generates endless criticism? The answer is that some things are more important than personal convenience.\n\nI came to America as an immigrant. This country gave me opportunities that would not have existed anywhere else. Tesla, SpaceX, and everything I have built is possible because of American freedom, American capital markets, and American willingness to let someone with crazy ideas actually try them. I owe America a debt that cannot be repaid with tax dollars alone.\n\nThe federal government in its current form is a threat to American prosperity and freedom. It spends money we do not have, regulates activities that should be free, and grows regardless of results. If someone does not intervene, this trajectory leads to fiscal crisis and decline. I would rather be criticized for trying than comfortable while watching America weaken.\n\nAdditionally, I genuinely believe in Donald Trump's vision for the country. We do not agree on everything, but we agree on the core problem: Washington is broken, and career politicians will not fix it because they benefit from the brokenness. It takes outsiders to change a system designed to resist change.\n\n## My Relationship with President Trump\n\nPresident Trump and I have developed a genuine friendship and working relationship. We speak regularly, sometimes multiple times per day. He is deeply engaged with the DOGE mission and personally reviews our recommendations. When bureaucrats resist, he backs us up.\n\nSome people find our relationship surprising given our different backgrounds. He is a real estate developer from New York; I am a tech entrepreneur originally from South Africa. But we share a core belief: results matter more than process, and bold action beats cautious incrementalism. We both built businesses by ignoring conventional wisdom and doing things that experts said could not be done.\n\nI appreciate that he takes my calls at any hour and actually listens to data-driven arguments. He does not pretend to have expertise he lacks. When I explain something technical, he asks good questions and makes decisions quickly. This is refreshing compared to the analysis paralysis that characterizes much of government.\n\n## What Success Looks Like\n\nBy July 4, 2026, I want DOGE to have achieved measurable, undeniable results. Here is what success looks like:\n\n- Identified at least $2 trillion in spending cuts and reforms, with a significant portion actually implemented\n- Eliminated or simplified thousands of regulations across major agencies\n- Modernized core government technology systems\n- Created a permanent culture of efficiency that will outlast any single administration\n- Published comprehensive data on government spending and performance that citizens can access and understand\n\nI am realistic that we will not achieve everything. Government reform is a multi-decade project. But we can shift the trajectory. We can prove that efficiency is possible. We can create tools and precedents that future reformers can build upon.\n\n## The Bigger Picture: Why Government Efficiency Matters\n\nThis is not just about saving money, though that matters. Efficient government is more responsive to citizens. It accomplishes its legitimate functions better. It leaves more resources in the private sector where innovation happens. It reduces the burden on businesses and individuals who currently spend enormous time and money complying with unnecessary requirements.\n\nAmerica faces real challenges: competition from China, infrastructure decay, educational decline, and fiscal unsustainability. We cannot address these challenges with a government that consumes more resources each year while delivering worse outcomes. Reform is not optional. The only question is whether we reform proactively or wait for crisis to force reform under much worse conditions.\n\nI believe we are at an inflection point. The combination of President Trump's mandate, public frustration with government dysfunction, and technological tools that make analysis possible creates a unique opportunity. DOGE is my attempt to seize that opportunity.\n\n## My Commitment and Timeline\n\nI have publicly committed to this role through the 250th anniversary of American independence, July 4, 2026. After that, I will step back to focus on my companies. But I will have spent these 18 months building something that can continue without me: a methodology for identifying waste, a culture of accountability, and a public expectation that government should perform.\n\nThis is not a permanent move to Washington. I continue to run Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, xAI, and X. The DOGE work is additional, which means I am working more hours than ever. But I can do this for 18 months. I cannot do it forever, and I should not have to. The goal is systemic change, not personal indispensability.\n\n## Final Thoughts on This Mission\n\nWhen people ask what I am doing for Trump, the honest answer is: trying to fix a broken system that both parties have let rot for decades. This is not about partisan politics. Waste is not Republican or Democrat. Inefficiency hurts all Americans.\n\nI took this on because I believe it matters and because I have skills that can make a difference. Building and running companies teaches you how to identify inefficiency and eliminate it. That mindset is exactly what Washington lacks.\n\nWill we succeed completely? Probably not. The forces of bureaucratic inertia are powerful. But will we make meaningful progress? Absolutely. And sometimes that is enough. You do not have to solve every problem to make the world better. You just have to move the needle in the right direction.\n\nThat is what I am doing for Trump. That is what I am doing for America. And whatever the critics say, I am proud to be doing it.",
