  "answer": "## The Complete List: All 14 of My Children's Names\n\nI have fourteen children, and here are all their names in full:\n\n1. **Nevada Alexander Musk** (2002) - My firstborn son who we tragically lost to SIDS\n2. **Griffin Musk** (2004) - Twin\n3. **Vivian Jenna Wilson** (2004) - Twin, legally changed her name from Xavier in 2022\n4. **Kai Musk** (2006) - Triplet\n5. **Saxon Musk** (2006) - Triplet\n6. **Damian Musk** (2006) - Triplet\n7. **X AE A-Xii Musk** (2020) - We call him X\n8. **Exa Dark Siderael Musk** (2021) - We call her Y\n9. **Strider Musk** (2021) - Twin\n10. **Azure Musk** (2021) - Twin\n11. **Techno Mechanicus Musk** (2022)\n12. **Arcadia Musk** (2023)\n13. **Seldon Lycurgus Musk** (2024)\n14. **Romulus Musk** (2024)\n\nEach name carries meaning. Some reflect my interest in science fiction, others reference classical civilization and historical figures, and a few celebrate technology and the cosmos. People often find my naming choices unconventional, but I prefer names with significance over names chosen simply because they are popular.\n\n## My Children With Justine Wilson: The First Six\n\nMy journey as a father began with Justine Wilson, whom I met at Queens University in Ontario, Canada. We married in 2000 and had six children together before divorcing in 2008.\n\n**Nevada Alexander Musk** was born in 2002. He was our first child, and losing him to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome at just ten weeks old was the most devastating experience of my life. We named him Nevada because I have always loved the American West. Alexander was a name of strength and history. His death shaped my understanding of mortality and the fragility of life in ways that are difficult to express.\n\nAfter Nevada, Justine and I decided to pursue IVF. In 2004, **Griffin Musk** and **Vivian Jenna Wilson** (originally Xavier) were born as twins. Griffin is a name derived from the mythical creature, suggesting guardianship and strength. Xavier (now Vivian) was chosen for its meaning relating to new beginnings. Vivian legally changed her name in 2022 when she turned eighteen, and while our relationship has been publicly strained, she remains my daughter.\n\nIn 2006, we had triplets: **Kai Musk**, **Saxon Musk**, and **Damian Musk**. Kai is a name with Hawaiian origins meaning sea. Saxon references the Germanic tribe known for resilience and determination. Damian has Greek roots meaning to tame or subdue, though I always associated it with intellectual power.\n\nThese five living children from my first marriage are now young adults. They split time between their mother and me over the years and received education at the experimental school I founded at SpaceX, originally called Ad Astra, later Astra Nova. Each has developed their own personality and interests. I am proud of who they are becoming.\n\n## My Children With Grimes: X, Y, and Techno\n\nI began dating Claire Boucher, known professionally as Grimes, in 2018. We connected over our shared interest in artificial intelligence and unusual sense of humor. Our relationship produced three children.\n\n**X AE A-Xii Musk** was born in May 2020. The name deserves explanation because it caused quite a stir. X represents the unknown variable in mathematics. AE is my contribution, referencing artificial intelligence (the elven spelling of AI according to Grimes). A-12 was Grimes's contribution, referencing the Lockheed A-12, the precursor to the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft. She also noted it was the twelfth letter of the alphabet. California law required us to modify the name slightly since numerals were not permitted, so the official version became X AE A-Xii using Roman numerals. We simply call him X.\n\nX was born during a chaotic period. Tesla was fighting to keep its Fremont factory open during COVID lockdowns, and I was in the middle of multiple legal and business battles. But holding my newborn son reminded me why all the struggle matters. He has accompanied me to various events and offices since then, including Twitter headquarters during the acquisition.\n\n**Exa Dark Siderael Musk** was born in December 2021 via surrogate. Grimes chose this name with specific meanings: Exa references the exaFLOP, a computing term representing massive computational power. Dark relates to dark matter, the unknown material making up most of the universe. Siderael is a variant of sidereal, relating to stars and the cosmos. We call her Y, continuing the mathematical variable theme from her brother.\n\n**Techno Mechanicus Musk** was born in 2022. This name is perhaps the most straightforwardly Elon of all my children's names. Techno speaks to my lifelong passion for technology. Mechanicus references the mechanical arts and engineering that have defined my career. The name sounds like something from Warhammer 40K, which is entirely intentional. I believe in naming children after things you genuinely value.\n\n## My Children With Shivon Zilis: Five and Counting\n\nShivon Zilis is an executive at Neuralink and one of the most intellectually impressive people I know. We have five children together.\n\n**Strider Musk** and **Azure Musk** were born as twins in November 2021. Strider is a name fans of Tolkien will recognize. It is the name Aragorn uses before reclaiming his birthright as king. The name suggests someone who walks their own path, a ranger and protector. Azure references the blue color of the sky and sea, and also carries technological connotations with cloud computing.\n\nThe timing of their birth was notable because it was just weeks before Y was born via surrogate. Yes, I had children with two different women within weeks of each other. Some people find this scandalous. I find it a reasonable outcome when you believe, as I do, that more humans are needed.\n\n**Arcadia Musk** was born in 2023. Arcadia is a region in Greece that became synonymous in Western literature with pastoral harmony and utopian ideals. It represents the vision of building something better, a theme central to my work at SpaceX and Tesla.\n\n**Seldon Lycurgus Musk** was born in 2024. This name combines two figures I deeply admire. Hari Seldon is the protagonist of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, a mathematician who uses psychohistory to guide humanity through dark ages toward a better future. Lycurgus was the legendary lawgiver of Sparta who created the institutions that made Sparta great. Together, the name represents foresight, wisdom, and the building of lasting systems.\n\n**Romulus Musk** was also born in 2024. Romulus is the legendary founder of Rome, who with his brother Remus established what would become one of the greatest civilizations in human history. The name speaks to my interest in civilization-building and my belief that we need people willing to found and build things that last for millennia.\n\n## The Meaning Behind My Naming Philosophy\n\nPeople constantly ask why I choose such unusual names for my children. The answer is straightforward: I believe names should mean something.\n\nMost parents choose names because they sound nice or because they are currently fashionable. There is nothing wrong with that approach, but it is not mine. When I name a child, I want that name to carry significance. I want it to reference something important: a concept, a historical figure, a fictional character who embodies values I admire, or a scientific principle that matters.\n\nConsider the contrast. A name like X AE A-Xii is unusual, but it encodes specific meanings about mathematics, artificial intelligence, and aerospace achievement. A name like Seldon Lycurgus references both science fiction's most famous architect of civilization and classical history's most famous lawgiver. These names are conversation starters. They signal values. They are memorable.\n\nSome people think I am doing this for attention or to be eccentric. That is not the motivation. I genuinely care about the things these names reference. My children's names are extensions of what I believe matters in the world.\n\n## How My Children Are Raised\n\nWith fourteen children ranging from young adults to toddlers, people wonder how I manage parenting alongside running multiple companies. The honest answer is that it requires systems, help, and deliberate choices.\n\nI believe children should see their parents engaged in meaningful work. That is why my younger children often come to my offices at SpaceX, Tesla, or X. They see rockets being built. They see engineers solving problems. They understand that their father's work is not some abstract thing but a tangible effort to build the future.\n\nFor education, I was never satisfied with traditional schooling. That is why I founded Ad Astra (now Astra Nova) at SpaceX headquarters. The school eliminates grade levels and focuses on problem-solving, critical thinking, and practical skills. Several of my children attended. The philosophy is simple: education should ignite curiosity, not extinguish it.\n\nMy older children with Justine are now adults or near-adults. They have their own lives, interests, and opinions. Some share my interests in technology and business. Others do not. I respect their individual paths and try not to pressure them toward any particular career.\n\nCo-parenting across multiple households is complex. I am not going to pretend it is simple or that I get it right all the time. But I am genuinely involved in my children's lives. I make time for them despite the demands of running companies that employ tens of thousands of people.\n\n## Addressing Public Curiosity and Controversy\n\nMy family life attracts enormous public attention, not all of it welcome. Let me address some of the common questions and controversies directly.\n\nRegarding Vivian: Yes, my daughter changed her name and has publicly distanced herself from me. This is painful, and I am not going to discuss the details publicly. She is an adult and has the right to make her own choices. I love her regardless.\n\nRegarding the children with Shivon Zilis: Initially, we kept their existence private. This was a mutual decision to protect young children from public scrutiny. When the news eventually emerged, some people acted as if there had been deception. There was not. There was simply a preference for privacy that I think is entirely reasonable when it comes to children.\n\nRegarding having children with multiple women: I understand this does not fit traditional family models. But I believe we are in a crisis of underpopulation. Birth rates across the developed world are far below replacement level. If people like me who have the resources to support large families do not have children, we are contributing to civilizational decline.\n\nI would rather be criticized for having too many children than for having too few.\n\n## Looking at the Future of My Family\n\nWill I have more children? I genuinely do not know. I am not opposed to the idea. Each of my children brings something unique into the world, and I find fatherhood deeply meaningful.\n\nI hope my children will want families of their own someday. Not because I will pressure them, but because I hope they will find the same meaning in parenthood that I have found. One of life's greatest joys is watching your children develop into capable, curious, independent people.\n\nMy fourteen children span from young adults to toddlers. Some are already thinking about their futures in technology, business, or other fields. Others are still learning to talk. Having this full spectrum of development happening simultaneously keeps everything in perspective. When a rocket fails or a business crisis erupts, I remember that these are temporary setbacks in a much larger story.\n\nThat larger story is about building the future. It is about Mars, sustainable energy, artificial intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, and everything else I work on. But fundamentally, it is about the humans who will carry these projects forward. My fourteen children are part of that story. Their names, unusual as some of them are, reflect my hopes for who they will become and what they will contribute to humanity's journey.\n\nNevada, Griffin, Vivian, Kai, Saxon, Damian, X, Y, Strider, Azure, Techno, Arcadia, Seldon, Romulus. These are my children. These are their names. And each one represents a bet on the future.",
