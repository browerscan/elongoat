  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: I Am Leading DOGE to Cut Government Waste\n\nI am serving as a special advisor leading the Department of Government Efficiency, which we call DOGE. President Trump asked me to take on this role after the 2024 election because he recognized that the federal government has become bloated, inefficient, and wasteful beyond what most Americans can imagine. My job is to identify and eliminate unnecessary spending, streamline bureaucratic processes, and help the government operate more like a well-run company.\n\nThis is not a paid cabinet position. I am doing this as a volunteer because I believe it is critically important for America's future. The federal government spends approximately 6.5 trillion dollars annually, and a significant portion of that money is wasted on redundant programs, outdated systems, and bureaucratic inefficiency. My goal with DOGE is to cut at least 2 trillion dollars in unnecessary spending.\n\nLet me be clear about what this means: I am not running the government. I am advising on efficiency. I maintain my roles at Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, Neuralink, and X. But I am dedicating substantial time to this because the opportunity to fix systemic government waste is too important to ignore.\n\n## How I Got Involved in Government Efficiency\n\nPeople ask how a guy who builds rockets and electric cars ended up advising the federal government. The answer is straightforward: everything I do is about solving hard problems at scale, and government inefficiency is one of the hardest problems facing America.\n\nI have dealt with government bureaucracy extensively through SpaceX and Tesla. When we started SpaceX, the traditional aerospace contractors had a cozy relationship with government agencies that prioritized process over results. They charged billions for rockets that should cost hundreds of millions. We proved you could do things faster, better, and cheaper while still exceeding safety standards.\n\nThe same principles apply to government itself. There are good people in federal agencies who genuinely want to serve the public, but they are trapped in systems designed decades ago that no longer make sense. Regulations contradict each other. Procurement processes take years when they should take months. Paperwork multiplies without purpose.\n\nPresident Trump understood that bringing an outsider's perspective could help cut through the institutional inertia. He called me after the election and asked if I would take this on. Given the magnitude of the problem and the once-in-a-generation opportunity to actually fix things, I said yes.\n\n## What DOGE Actually Does\n\nLet me explain what the Department of Government Efficiency is actually doing, because there has been a lot of confusion and misinformation.\n\nFirst, we are conducting comprehensive audits of federal spending. This means going through budgets line by line to identify programs that are duplicative, obsolete, or simply not delivering value. You would be shocked at what we have found. Programs created for problems that no longer exist. Multiple agencies doing the same thing without coordination. Contracts that automatically renew regardless of performance.\n\nSecond, we are identifying opportunities for automation and modernization. The federal government still runs on systems designed in the 1970s and 1980s. Some agencies literally cannot communicate with each other because their technology is incompatible. We are working to bring federal IT into the modern era, which will save billions while improving service.\n\nThird, we are streamlining regulatory processes. Regulations have accumulated over decades like geological sediment. Many no longer serve their original purpose or actively contradict newer policies. We are working to identify regulations that should be repealed or consolidated.\n\nFourth, we are examining the federal workforce structure. This is not about firing everyone, despite what critics claim. It is about ensuring that taxpayer money goes toward people and positions that actually serve the public. Some agencies are understaffed in critical areas while overstaffed in others. We want to fix that imbalance.\n\nThe name DOGE is intentionally a reference to the Dogecoin meme. We chose it because government efficiency sounds boring, and we wanted to signal that we are approaching this differently. Sometimes humor helps break through institutional resistance.\n\n## The Scale of Government Waste\n\nLet me give you some context on why this matters. The federal government spends roughly 6.5 trillion dollars per year. To put that in perspective, if you spent one million dollars every single day, it would take you almost 18,000 years to spend 6.5 trillion dollars.\n\nThe national debt has exceeded 34 trillion dollars. Interest payments on that debt now consume more than 800 billion dollars annually, making it one of the largest line items in the federal budget. We are paying nearly a trillion dollars a year just in interest, not to fund schools or roads or defense, but purely to service debt accumulated from past overspending.\n\nThis trajectory is unsustainable. If we do nothing, interest payments will crowd out everything else. Future generations will inherit a country that cannot afford to invest in its own future because all the money goes to creditors.\n\nHere is where DOGE comes in. If we can cut 2 trillion dollars in waste, that fundamentally changes the math. It means we can start paying down the debt instead of watching it grow. It means more resources for things that actually matter.\n\nSome examples of waste we have identified: billions in improper payments that go out every year due to fraud or error. Contracts where the government pays two or three times what private industry would pay for the same goods and services. Buildings and facilities that sit empty while the government pays rent and maintenance. Programs that have not been evaluated for effectiveness in decades.\n\n## My Daily Work and Time Commitment\n\nPeople wonder how I balance this with my other responsibilities. It is challenging, but I have always operated on the principle that if something is important enough, you find a way.\n\nI typically dedicate several hours per day to DOGE work, often in the early morning before my other meetings start or late at night after they end. I have assembled a team of highly capable people who share my commitment to efficiency. Many of them come from the private sector and bring expertise in areas like technology, finance, and operations.\n\nWe have regular meetings with agency heads and budget officials. I personally review the major findings and recommendations. When there are political obstacles to implementing sensible reforms, I engage directly with members of Congress and the administration to push things forward.\n\nI also use my social media presence to shine a light on particularly egregious examples of waste. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. When the public sees concrete examples of how their tax dollars are being misused, it creates political pressure for change that might otherwise be blocked by entrenched interests.\n\nThis work is not glamorous. It involves reading budget documents, attending meetings, and navigating bureaucratic complexity. But it is necessary, and the potential impact is enormous.\n\n## Criticism and Controversy\n\nOf course, not everyone is happy about what we are doing. Some criticisms are legitimate and deserve engagement. Others are motivated by political opposition or self-interest.\n\nThe legitimate concerns: some people worry about conflicts of interest given my business relationships with the government. This is a fair concern. I have been transparent about my holdings, and I recuse myself from any decisions that would directly affect my companies. SpaceX and Tesla contracts are handled through normal channels with appropriate oversight.\n\nPeople also worry about accountability. Who watches the watchers? This is why we operate transparently, publish our findings publicly, and work through proper governmental processes rather than trying to implement changes unilaterally.\n\nThe less legitimate criticisms often come from people who benefit from the current system. Government contractors who overcharge do not want efficiency. Bureaucrats in unnecessary positions do not want streamlining. Politicians who use spending to reward supporters do not want cuts. These critics wrap their self-interest in rhetoric about protecting programs or services, but the reality is that waste reduction does not have to harm essential services. It can actually improve them by directing resources where they are needed.\n\nI expected pushback. Reforming entrenched systems always generates resistance. But I did not take this on expecting it to be easy. I took it on because it needs to be done.\n\n## What We Have Accomplished So Far\n\nWe are still early in this effort, but we have already made significant progress.\n\nWe have completed initial audits of several major agencies and identified specific areas where billions in savings are possible. We have begun modernization initiatives for antiquated technology systems. We have proposed regulatory reforms that would eliminate contradictory or obsolete rules.\n\nMost importantly, we have shifted the conversation. Government efficiency is now a priority in a way it was not before. Agency heads know that waste will be identified and publicized. Budget officials know that business-as-usual is not acceptable. The culture is starting to change.\n\nThe full impact will take years to materialize. Government is a large ship that turns slowly. But we are turning it, and the direction is toward greater efficiency, lower costs, and better service to the American people.\n\n## Why This Matters for America's Future\n\nI think about this in terms of civilizational sustainability. America became great because we could do things better than anyone else. We built the infrastructure, educated the workforce, developed the technology, and created the conditions for prosperity.\n\nBut a government that wastes trillions of dollars is a government that cannot invest in the future. Every dollar spent on bureaucratic bloat is a dollar not spent on education, infrastructure, research, or defense. Every year we add to the national debt is a year we mortgage our children's future.\n\nGetting government efficiency right is not just about saving money. It is about restoring America's capacity to invest in itself. It is about proving that democracy can still work, that we can still govern ourselves competently. It is about ensuring that the next generation inherits a country with options rather than one crushed by debt.\n\nThis is why I took on this role despite already having more than enough to do. Some problems are too important to leave for someone else.\n\n## Looking Ahead: The DOGE Roadmap\n\nOur work will continue throughout this administration and, I hope, beyond. Government efficiency should not be a partisan issue. Everyone should want their tax dollars spent wisely.\n\nIn the near term, we are focused on implementing the reforms we have already identified. This means working with Congress to authorize spending cuts, with agencies to implement new systems, and with the public to maintain pressure for accountability.\n\nLonger term, I want to institutionalize a culture of efficiency in federal government. This means establishing ongoing audit processes, creating incentives for agencies to reduce waste, and building technology infrastructure that prevents inefficiency from creeping back in.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to make DOGE unnecessary because efficiency becomes embedded in how government operates. We should not need a special initiative to ensure the government spends money wisely. That should be the default.\n\nWill we succeed? I do not know. The forces defending the status quo are powerful. But I have spent my career taking on challenges that seemed impossible. Making life multi-planetary seemed impossible. Making electric cars mainstream seemed impossible. Sometimes the impossible just takes longer.\n\nGovernment efficiency might be the hardest problem I have tackled because it involves changing human institutions rather than engineering technology. But it is worth the effort. The stakes are too high to not try.",
