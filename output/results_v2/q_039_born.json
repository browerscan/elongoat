  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa\n\nI was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. That makes me a Cancer according to Western astrology, though I put more stock in physics than horoscopes. Pretoria was the administrative capital of South Africa, and it was where my family had deep roots. I am currently 53 years old as of 2025, though by the time you read this, I may have had another birthday.\n\nMy birthplace and early years in South Africa shaped me in ways that took decades to fully understand. Growing up in Pretoria during apartheid, experiencing the harsh realities of both that system and a difficult childhood, reading voraciously about technology and science fiction, and eventually leaving for North America at age 17 - all of these elements combined to create the person who would later start companies like SpaceX and Tesla.\n\n## My Early Life in Pretoria\n\nPretoria in 1971 was a very different place from the South Africa of today. The country was under apartheid, a system of institutionalized racial segregation that would not fully end until 1994. I was born into a white family of significant means, which meant I experienced a version of South Africa that was privileged but also deeply problematic in retrospect.\n\nMy father was Errol Musk, an electromechanical engineer who worked on various projects including an emerald mine in Zambia. My mother was Maye Musk, a dietitian and model who would later become internationally known in her own right. I was their first child, followed by my brother Kimbal in 1972 and my sister Tosca in 1974.\n\nThe household I grew up in was complicated. My parents divorced when I was around nine years old, in 1980. After the divorce, I made the decision to live with my father. It was a choice I have come to deeply regret. My father is a difficult man, and my childhood years with him were marked by experiences I do not like to discuss in detail. I have said publicly that he did terrible things, though I prefer not to elaborate. Some memories are better left unexamined.\n\nWhat I will say is that my childhood was not easy. Beyond the challenges at home, I was bullied severely at school. South African schools in the 1980s could be brutal environments. I was small for my age, bookish, and not particularly athletic. I was thrown down a flight of stairs by bullies and beaten so badly that I was hospitalized. These experiences taught me early that the world could be cruel and that I would need to find my own path.\n\n## Books, Computers, and Dreaming of Space\n\nIf there was one escape from the difficulties of my childhood, it was reading. I consumed books at an extraordinary rate. The local library eventually ran out of books I had not read, so I started on the encyclopedia. I read the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica. This might sound like an exaggeration, but it is not. When you are a lonely kid with a difficult home life, books become your universe.\n\nScience fiction had a particularly profound impact on me. Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, which imagines a galactic civilization and the mathematics of predicting its future, planted seeds that would eventually grow into my interest in ensuring humanity becomes a multi-planetary species. Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy taught me that the universe could be both vast and absurd. Robert Heinlein's works reinforced my belief in self-reliance and the importance of pushing boundaries.\n\nI also discovered computers around age 10. My father bought a Commodore VIC-20, and I taught myself to program. Within two years, at age 12, I had created and sold my first piece of software: a video game called Blastar. A South African magazine called PC and Office Technology published the code and paid me approximately 500 dollars. It was not a huge sum, but it was proof that I could create something of value.\n\nThese twin passions, reading about space and working with computers, would define my entire career. Even as a child in Pretoria, I was dreaming about rockets and building software. The specific details of those dreams have changed, but the fundamental drive has remained constant.\n\n## Growing Up During Apartheid\n\nI cannot discuss my South African upbringing without addressing apartheid. I was born into a system that was morally indefensible. As a white South African, I benefited from that system in ways that are uncomfortable to acknowledge. The schools I attended, the neighborhoods I lived in, the opportunities available to my family, all of these were shaped by a brutal hierarchy of race.\n\nDid I understand the full horror of apartheid as a child? Not completely. Children often accept the world as they find it. But as I grew older, I became increasingly aware that something was deeply wrong with how my country was organized. The violence, the inequality, the fundamental injustice of it all became impossible to ignore.\n\nThis was one factor, among several, in my decision to leave South Africa. I did not want to serve in the South African military, which at the time was being used to enforce apartheid both domestically and in neighboring countries. The mandatory military service that awaited me was something I found morally objectionable. I wanted out.\n\n## Leaving South Africa at 17\n\nIn 1989, at age 17, I left South Africa for Canada. My mother was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, which meant I could claim Canadian citizenship through her. This was my escape route. I packed my bags, said goodbye to the only country I had ever known, and flew to Montreal.\n\nArriving in Canada with almost nothing was both terrifying and liberating. I had minimal money, no connections, and no clear plan beyond getting away from South Africa and eventually making it to the United States, which I viewed as the land of opportunity for someone interested in technology and entrepreneurship.\n\nThose early months in Canada were hard. I worked various jobs, including cleaning out a boiler room at a lumber mill, which paid well but was extremely unpleasant work. I also worked on a farm and at various other manual labor jobs. I was not above doing difficult physical work if it meant survival and eventually getting to where I wanted to be.\n\nI enrolled at Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, partly because I heard the ratio of women to men was favorable. I am being honest. I was a teenage boy. But it was also a good university, and it gave me the academic foundation I needed to eventually transfer to the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n## The Birthday That Changed Everything\n\nIf you had told me on June 28, 1971, what my life would become, it would have seemed like science fiction. The baby born in Pretoria that day would grow up to start an electric car company that would become the most valuable automaker in the world. That baby would build rockets that would land themselves and revolutionize the space industry. He would accumulate wealth that would make him one of the richest people in human history.\n\nBut here is what I find most meaningful about my birth story: it demonstrates that where you start does not determine where you end. I was born in South Africa, a country that at the time was isolated from much of the world due to apartheid. I had a difficult childhood with serious family problems. I was bullied and beaten. I had to leave my country with almost nothing.\n\nAnd yet, through reading, through computers, through an obsessive focus on the future, through a willingness to take enormous risks, I was able to build a life that has exceeded anything I could have imagined. June 28, 1971, was just the starting point. What mattered was everything that came after.\n\n## The Significance of My Birth Year\n\nBeing born in 1971 placed me at an interesting moment in history. I was too young to remember the Apollo moon landings, but old enough to be deeply influenced by their aftermath. The space program of the 1960s and early 1970s represented humanity at its most ambitious. Then, inexplicably to my young mind, we stopped. We went to the moon and then we just... stopped going.\n\nThis timing shaped my entire worldview. I grew up believing that space exploration was humanity's destiny, but also watching that destiny stall. The gap between what I read in science fiction and what humanity was actually doing in space became a source of profound frustration. It is a frustration that eventually led me to start SpaceX.\n\nBeing born in 1971 also meant I came of age during the personal computer revolution. I was 10 when I got my first computer, 13 when the Macintosh was released, and 24 when Netscape went public and the internet became a mainstream phenomenon. My generation was perfectly positioned to ride the wave of digital transformation. I did not plan this timing, but I was able to capitalize on it.\n\n## Reflections at 53\n\nAs I write this in 2025, I am 53 years old. More than half a century has passed since that June day in Pretoria. I have built multiple companies, had 14 children, accumulated and occasionally lost vast sums of money, become one of the most famous and controversial people on the planet, and worked on problems ranging from electric vehicles to brain-computer interfaces to interplanetary colonization.\n\nWhen I look back at my birth and early years, I see both the trauma and the foundation. The difficult childhood gave me resilience and an outsider's perspective. The books gave me vision. The computers gave me tools. The decision to leave South Africa gave me access to the entrepreneurial ecosystem of North America.\n\nI am not nostalgic about my early years. There is too much pain mixed with the memories. But I am grateful that the circumstances of my birth, combined with my own choices and work, led me to where I am today. June 28, 1971, was just the beginning. And at 53, I feel like I am just getting started.\n\n## Looking Forward From My Birth Date\n\nPeople often ask me what I want my legacy to be. The answer is simple: I want humanity to become a multi-planetary species. I want us to solve sustainable energy. I want to expand the possibilities of human consciousness. These are the things that matter to me far more than any birthday celebration.\n\nEvery June 28, I have another year to reflect on whether I am making progress on these goals. Sometimes I feel we are moving forward. SpaceX continues to push the boundaries of what is possible. Tesla is transforming the automotive industry. Other times, I feel the urgency of how much more there is to do and how little time any of us really have.\n\nI was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. That is the simple answer to the question. But the fuller answer is that I was born into circumstances that could have trapped me, and I found a way out. I was born with a mind that could not stop questioning and imagining. I was born at a moment in history that allowed my particular obsessions to become globally significant companies.\n\nAnd every birthday, I am reminded that time is the one resource that even I cannot manufacture more of. So I keep working.",
