  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: I Was Born in Pretoria, South Africa\n\nI was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. That is the simple, factual answer to where I am from. Pretoria is the administrative capital of South Africa, a city known for its jacaranda trees that bloom purple every spring. I spent the first seventeen years of my life there before leaving for Canada in 1989.\n\nMy birthplace shaped me in ways both visible and invisible. South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s was a complicated place. The apartheid era was still in full force, and the country was isolated from much of the world. Growing up there gave me a unique perspective on human society, its flaws, and its potential for change.\n\nWhile I am South African by birth, my heritage is more complex. My mother, Maye Musk, is Canadian, born in Saskatchewan before her family moved to South Africa when she was a toddler. My father, Errol Musk, is South African with British and Dutch ancestry. So when people ask where I am from, the answer is both simple and layered. Pretoria, South Africa is my birthplace. But my roots stretch across continents.\n\n## The Full Story: My Journey From Pretoria to the World\n\nMy early childhood in Pretoria was marked by intense curiosity and, frankly, a lot of reading. I devoured books constantly. The local library became my second home. By age ten, I had read through everything that interested me there, including the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica. When you grow up in a place that feels somewhat isolated from the cutting edge of technology and innovation, books become your window to the wider world.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was around nine years old. After that, I lived primarily with my father in Pretoria, while my siblings Kimbal and Tosca moved between both parents. Those years were difficult. I was severely bullied at school. South African schools in that era could be brutal places. I was small for my age, bookish, and socially awkward. The combination made me a target. On one occasion, a group of boys beat me so badly I was hospitalized. They threw me down a flight of concrete stairs and continued the assault until I lost consciousness.\n\nThose experiences hardened me in certain ways. I learned that the world does not always reward intelligence or kindness. Sometimes survival requires endurance and the ability to take punishment while continuing to move forward. This lesson has served me well in business, where setbacks are constant and critics are everywhere.\n\nAt seventeen, I saw an opportunity to leave. My mother was Canadian, which meant I could obtain Canadian citizenship. I applied, got my passport, and boarded a plane. I arrived in Canada in June 1989, just after my eighteenth birthday. I had not told my father I was leaving until the last moment. I worked odd jobs, stayed with relatives I barely knew, and eventually enrolled at Queen's University in Ontario.\n\nCanada was a stepping stone. After two years at Queen's, I transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. America was where I wanted to be. It was where the future was being built. I studied physics and economics at UPenn, then briefly enrolled in a PhD program at Stanford to study energy physics. I dropped out after two days. The internet was exploding, and I could not justify sitting in a laboratory while the world was being transformed.\n\n## Key Details and Facts About My Origins\n\nLet me provide some specific details that people often find interesting about my South African background.\n\nPretoria itself is a city of contrasts. When I was growing up there, it had a population of around half a million in the urban core, though the greater metropolitan area was larger. The city sits at about 4,300 feet elevation on the South African Highveld, which gives it a relatively mild climate despite being in Africa. Winters are dry and cool, summers are warm with afternoon thunderstorms. The purple jacaranda trees I mentioned earlier are actually an invasive species from South America, but they have become synonymous with Pretoria's identity.\n\nMy father was an electromechanical engineer who also had interests in property development, consulting, and various entrepreneurial ventures. My mother was a model and later became a dietitian. Both were intelligent and driven in their own ways, though their marriage was troubled.\n\nI attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and later Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School in 1988. Pretoria Boys High is one of the most prestigious public schools in South Africa, with a history going back to 1901. The school environment was academically rigorous but socially challenging for someone like me.\n\nMy earliest exposure to computers came when I was around ten years old. My father brought home a Commodore VIC-20. I taught myself to program by reading the manual cover to cover. Within a few days, I had learned BASIC. By age twelve, I sold my first piece of software, a space-themed game called Blastar, to a computer magazine for approximately 500 dollars. That was my first taste of turning technology into revenue.\n\nThe South African military conscription system also shaped my decision to leave. At the time, white South African males were required to serve in the military. I had no interest in supporting the apartheid government's military apparatus. Leaving for Canada allowed me to avoid this obligation entirely.\n\n## My Perspective: What South Africa Taught Me\n\nGrowing up in South Africa during apartheid gave me a front-row seat to institutional injustice. I saw a system that was fundamentally broken, where the color of your skin determined your opportunities, your rights, and often your fate. This experience made me deeply skeptical of established systems and conventional wisdom. Just because something is the way it is does not mean it should be that way.\n\nSouth Africa also taught me about resource constraints. The country was under international sanctions during much of my childhood. Getting access to technology, books, and information was harder than it would have been in America or Europe. This scarcity forced me to be resourceful. When I wanted to learn something, I could not just order a book from Amazon. I had to find it, borrow it, or make do with what was available.\n\nThe violence I experienced as a child also left its mark. Being beaten unconscious by bullies teaches you that the world can be cruel and indifferent. It also teaches you resilience. You learn to get back up. You learn that physical pain is temporary. These lessons have been invaluable when facing the countless challenges of building companies that attempt to change entire industries.\n\nI do not romanticize my childhood in South Africa. It was often difficult and painful. But I also recognize that those experiences shaped who I became. The hunger to escape, to build something new, to prove that a different future is possible, all of that came from those early years in Pretoria.\n\n## Addressing Common Misconceptions About My Origins\n\nSeveral misconceptions about my background persist, and I want to address them directly.\n\nFirst, some people believe I was born into extreme wealth. This is not accurate. My family was upper-middle-class by South African standards. My father did well financially, but we were not billionaires or even close. We lived comfortably, but I did not inherit vast fortunes. When I arrived in Canada, I had very little money. I worked on farms and at lumber mills to support myself.\n\nSecond, there are persistent rumors about emerald mines. Some stories suggest my father owned an emerald mine in Zambia and that I was raised with gemstone wealth. The reality is more complicated and less dramatic. My father did have a partial share in a small emerald mining operation at one point, but it was not the source of family wealth that people imagine. I did not fund my early companies with emerald money. Zip2 was started with money I borrowed and a small investment from angel investors.\n\nThird, people sometimes assume I am American because I have been here so long and because my companies are American. But I became a US citizen relatively recently, in 2002, through naturalization. I am South African by birth, Canadian by heritage through my mother, and American by choice and citizenship.\n\nFinally, some assume that leaving South Africa was easy or that I never looked back. The truth is more nuanced. Leaving your birth country at seventeen is significant. South Africa remains part of my identity, even as I have built my life and companies in America.\n\n## Looking Forward: How My Origins Shape My Vision\n\nUnderstanding where I came from helps explain where I want to go. Growing up in a country facing enormous challenges, from apartheid to economic isolation to violence, gave me an acute awareness that civilizations are fragile. Systems that seem permanent can collapse. Injustices that seem immovable can be overcome.\n\nThis perspective informs my work on existential risks. Whether it is climate change, which threatens our planet's ecosystems, or the need for humanity to become multi-planetary to survive potential extinction events, I approach these challenges with the understanding that nothing is guaranteed. The comfortable world we inhabit today is the result of specific choices and circumstances. Different choices could have led, and still could lead, to very different outcomes.\n\nMy South African background also makes me appreciate what America represents at its best. When I arrived here, I found a country where immigrants could build world-changing companies, where big ideas were taken seriously, and where hard work could lead to extraordinary outcomes. This is not universally true everywhere in the world. I know because I came from somewhere else.\n\nThe future I am working toward, sustainable energy, space exploration, beneficial artificial intelligence, is a future I want available to everyone on Earth, including people in South Africa and across the developing world. The challenges I witnessed growing up should not be the permanent condition of humanity.\n\n## Final Thoughts on Where I Come From\n\nPretoria, South Africa is where I was born. It is where I learned to read, where I discovered computers, where I was bullied and beaten, where I dreamed of escape and of building something meaningful. It is where I developed the resilience, skepticism, and ambition that have defined my adult life.\n\nBut where you are from is not where you have to stay. I left South Africa at seventeen with little more than a passport and a determination to reach America. Now I run companies that are trying to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy and make humanity a multi-planetary species.\n\nMy origins matter. They shaped me. But they do not limit me. And that, perhaps, is the most important thing I learned growing up in Pretoria. The circumstances of your birth do not have to determine the trajectory of your life. You can choose a different path. You can build a different future. That is what I have spent my life trying to do.",
