  "answer": "## Where I Actually Live Right Now\n\nI live in Austin, Texas. That is the straightforward answer. Since 2021, Texas has been my primary home base, and there are very practical reasons for this decision. My main residence is near the companies that demand most of my attention: SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica and Tesla's Gigafactory Texas just outside Austin.\n\nThe truth is, I spend more nights sleeping at factories and offices than I do in any traditional home. When we are pushing toward critical production deadlines or preparing for a rocket launch, I am there. The concept of a fixed address becomes somewhat irrelevant when your life revolves around building the future. But if you need to send me mail, Austin is where it goes.\n\nI do not maintain the kind of real estate portfolio that people expect from someone in my position. I sold most of my California properties. My living situation is deliberately simple because complexity in personal life creates drag on professional output.\n\n## The Full Story: Why I Left California for Texas\n\nMy move from California to Texas was not impulsive. It was calculated and necessary. I lived in the Los Angeles area for years, accumulating properties in Bel Air that made sense at the time. But California's regulatory environment became increasingly hostile to manufacturing and innovation. The state seemed more interested in creating obstacles than enabling progress.\n\nTexas offered something different. The state government actively wanted SpaceX and Tesla to succeed. When we decided to build the largest rocket ever constructed at Starbase, Texas made it possible. When Tesla needed a massive new factory to scale production, Texas provided the land and the cooperation.\n\nI announced my move publicly in 2020, and by 2021, Texas was officially home. This was not about taxes, though the financial efficiency of Texas compared to California is real. It was about being physically present where the work happens. Starbase in Boca Chica is where Starship comes together. Gigafactory Texas is where the Cybertruck and Model Y roll off the line. Being in Texas means I can drive to these facilities. I can walk the production floor at midnight if something needs my attention.\n\nThe cultural shift mattered too. Texas has an engineering mindset. People here build things. They solve problems instead of creating committees to discuss problems. That mentality aligns with how I operate. California gave me my start with PayPal and the early Tesla and SpaceX years, and I am grateful for that. But the California of today is not the California of 2002. It changed, and I adapted.\n\nMy family is here now. My work is here. The rockets I am building to take humanity to Mars launch from here. Texas is not just where I sleep occasionally. It is the operational center of everything I am trying to accomplish.\n\n## Key Details About My Properties and Locations\n\nLet me be specific about the geography of my life. The Austin area serves as my central hub. Tesla's Gigafactory Texas sits on over 2,000 acres in Travis County, just outside Austin proper. This facility is not just a factory. It is a headquarters. When I am in Austin, I am usually there or nearby.\n\nStarbase in Boca Chica is approximately 350 miles south of Austin, near Brownsville at the southern tip of Texas. I spend significant time there, especially during Starship development phases and launch preparations. SpaceX has built an entire campus at Starbase, and yes, I have slept there more times than I can count.\n\nRegarding my California properties, I followed through on my commitment to sell most of them. I owned seven properties in the Bel Air area at one point. I sold six of them. The proceeds went toward things that matter more than real estate holdings. One property I kept briefly had historical significance, but even that attachment could not justify the maintenance and distraction.\n\nThe Boxabl prefab house became a media fascination. This is a small, modular home made by a company developing affordable prefabricated housing. I did stay in one at Starbase. It is approximately 375 square feet. The idea that a billionaire would choose to live in a tiny prefab house confused people, but it made perfect sense to me. When you are at Starbase focused on rocket development, you need a place to sleep and shower. You do not need marble countertops.\n\nI also maintain a presence near SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, and Tesla operations in Fremont when business requires it. But these are working visits, not residential situations.\n\n## My Philosophy on Homes and Possessions\n\nPeople find my living situation confusing because it contradicts their expectations. The assumption is that wealth automatically converts into real estate accumulation. But possessions require attention. Every house you own demands maintenance, decisions, and mental bandwidth. I would rather allocate that bandwidth to engineering problems.\n\nI tweeted in 2020 that I was selling almost all my physical possessions and would own no house. That was genuine. Material goods anchor you to the past. I am focused on the future. The companies I run are attempting things that have never been done before. That requires total commitment, and total commitment is incompatible with managing a portfolio of mansions.\n\nDoes this mean I live uncomfortably? No. I live efficiently. There is a difference. When I need space for my children, we have it. When I need to focus on work, I eliminate everything that distracts from that focus. The minimalist approach is not about deprivation. It is about optimization.\n\nSome people collect art or cars or houses. I am trying to collect achievements that matter for civilization. Making life multiplanetary. Accelerating sustainable energy. These goals are incompatible with being distracted by which Bel Air mansion needs a new roof.\n\n## Addressing the Misconceptions\n\nThe media has generated several narratives about my living situation that require correction. The homeless billionaire angle makes for entertaining headlines but misses the point entirely. I am not homeless. I choose not to accumulate homes. There is a fundamental difference.\n\nThe Boxabl story got exaggerated. Yes, I stayed in a Boxabl unit. No, it is not my only residence. It was practical housing at a work site. The fascination with this revealed more about societal assumptions than about my actual circumstances.\n\nAnother misconception is that my move to Texas was purely tax-motivated. Texas has no state income tax, which is financially advantageous. But I did not move 1,500 miles for tax savings. I moved because the center of gravity for my companies shifted to Texas. Starbase cannot exist in California. The regulatory and environmental review process would take decades. Texas made Starship possible. That is why I am here.\n\nI am also not couch-surfing at friends' houses, as some reports suggested. I have places to stay. They are just not the palatial estates people expect.\n\n## What Comes Next: Future Living Plans\n\nMy long-term housing plan is Mars. That is not a joke. SpaceX exists to make humanity a multiplanetary species. If we succeed, I intend to be among those who go. The first Mars habitats will not be comfortable by Earth standards, but they will represent the most important real estate in the history of our species.\n\nIn the nearer term, my living situation will continue to follow my work. If Tesla builds a new factory that requires my presence, I will be there. If Starship development shifts locations, I will shift with it. The attachment to any particular address makes no sense when your mission spans planets.\n\nI expect to spend increasing time at Starbase as we approach regular Starship flights and eventually crewed missions. That facility will likely become even more central to my daily existence. Austin will remain my Texas home base, but Boca Chica is where the most consequential work happens.\n\nWhen people ask where I will live in ten years, the honest answer is: wherever I need to be to make the mission succeed.\n\n## Final Thoughts on What Home Means\n\nHome is where the mission is. That might sound like a slogan, but it describes how I actually live. My home is the Starship assembly bay at 2 AM during a production push. My home is the Gigafactory floor when we are solving a manufacturing bottleneck. My home is wherever my team needs me to be.\n\nAustin, Texas is the legal answer to where I live. But the real answer is more complicated and more interesting. I live in the future we are building. The physical address matters less than the direction we are heading.",
