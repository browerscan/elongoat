  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: I Am Based in Texas\n\nRight now, as you read this, I am most likely in one of three places: my home base in Austin, Texas near the Tesla Gigafactory and Boring Company headquarters, at SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica on the Texas Gulf Coast, or at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. The honest answer is that my location changes constantly because running multiple companies requires me to be physically present at different facilities depending on what critical work needs attention.\n\nIf I had to put a percentage on it, I spend roughly 40% of my time in Austin, 30% at Starbase in South Texas, 20% in California between SpaceX Hawthorne and the Bay Area, and the remaining 10% traveling internationally or to other facilities. But these percentages shift dramatically based on what is happening across my companies at any given moment.\n\n## Why Texas Became My Primary Home\n\nI officially moved to Texas in late 2020, and that decision was not made lightly. California had been my home for two decades. SpaceX was founded in El Segundo, and Tesla's headquarters was in Palo Alto. But Texas made sense for multiple compelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the regulatory environment. Texas state and local governments are genuinely supportive of manufacturing and innovation. When I wanted to build Gigafactory Texas, the permitting process was straightforward. When SpaceX needed to expand Starbase, we worked productively with local authorities. Compare that to California, where every project requires navigating layers of bureaucracy, environmental reviews that take years, and activist opposition to almost any development.\n\nSecond, the economics. Tesla's Gigafactory Texas represents over $10 billion in investment. The cost of building and operating that facility in California would have been significantly higher, not just because of real estate prices, but because of regulatory compliance costs, higher labor costs, and the general friction of doing business there.\n\nThird, SpaceX's future is in South Texas. Starbase is where we are building and launching Starship, the rocket that will take humans to Mars. You cannot build the world's largest and most powerful rocket in a densely populated urban area. The remote location of Boca Chica, right on the Gulf of Mexico with clear launch trajectories, makes it ideal for what we are trying to accomplish.\n\nI sold my California homes. I live in Texas now. My primary residence is in Austin, close enough to Gigafactory Texas that I can be on the factory floor in minutes when issues arise. And issues always arise in manufacturing.\n\n## My Typical Week: A Moving Target\n\nLet me walk you through what a typical week looks like, though I should emphasize that nothing about my schedule is truly typical. Every week brings different crises, opportunities, and demands.\n\nMonday through Wednesday often finds me in Austin. These are my days for Tesla meetings, reviewing production numbers, walking the Gigafactory floor, and handling the constant stream of decisions that running a car company requires. The Cybertruck production line demands particular attention right now. Ramping any new vehicle is incredibly difficult, and the Cybertruck's stainless steel exoskeleton and manufacturing innovations make it especially challenging.\n\nThursday and Friday frequently take me to Starbase. We are in the most critical phase of Starship development. Each test provides data that informs the next iteration. I need to be present for major tests and to help solve the engineering problems that inevitably emerge. There is something deeply satisfying about being at Starbase, watching the massive rockets take shape, knowing that these machines will eventually carry humans to Mars.\n\nWeekends are variable. Sometimes I am at SpaceX Hawthorne for Falcon 9 operations or Dragon capsule work. Sometimes I fly to the Bay Area for xAI work or meetings with engineering teams. Sometimes I stay in Texas with my children. The notion of weekends as rest days is not really part of my operating model.\n\n## Starbase: My Most Frequent Destination\n\nStarbase in Boca Chica, Texas, deserves special attention because I spend an enormous amount of time there, and it is unlike anywhere else on Earth. What was once a sleepy coastal area with a handful of residents has become the most ambitious rocket development facility in history.\n\nWhen I am at Starbase, I am typically there for 48 to 72 hours at a stretch. We have built living quarters, offices, and an entire support infrastructure for the thousands of engineers and technicians working on Starship. The rocket factory operates around the clock. The energy at Starbase is electric because everyone there knows they are working on technology that will define humanity's future.\n\nThe launches and tests are the most visible part of what happens at Starbase, but the real work is in the iterative engineering. We are constantly modifying, testing, learning, and improving. I participate directly in design reviews, walk the production lines, and engage with the engineering teams. You cannot build revolutionary rockets by managing from a distance.\n\n## California: Still a Major Part of My Work\n\nDespite moving to Texas, I still spend considerable time in California. SpaceX headquarters remains in Hawthorne, near Los Angeles International Airport. The Falcon 9 and Dragon programs operate from there. Our satellite operations, including Starlink, are managed from there. The institutional knowledge and talent at Hawthorne are irreplaceable.\n\nI also travel to Northern California regularly. Even though Tesla relocated its headquarters to Austin, we still have significant operations in the Bay Area, including engineering teams and the Fremont factory, which remains our highest-volume manufacturing facility. The xAI team has operations in the Bay Area as well.\n\nCalifornia is complicated for me. I have deep history there. My children from my first marriage grew up there. Many of my closest colleagues and friends are there. But the state's governance has made it increasingly difficult to operate businesses at scale. I still love California as a place, while being frustrated with California as a political and regulatory entity.\n\n## International Travel: Where I Go and Why\n\nMy international travel is primarily driven by specific business needs. Here are the destinations that come up most frequently:\n\nChina is crucial for Tesla. Gigafactory Shanghai is our most efficient factory and a major profit center. I travel there periodically to meet with government officials, inspect operations, and maintain the relationships that are essential for operating in that market. The Chinese EV market is the largest in the world, and Tesla's success there is strategically vital.\n\nGermany is home to Gigafactory Berlin, our European manufacturing hub. I visit regularly, especially when we are ramping new production lines or dealing with the unique challenges of operating in Europe. The regulatory environment in Germany is different from both the US and China, requiring hands-on attention.\n\nThe United Kingdom comes up occasionally for government meetings and events. I have met with UK officials to discuss investment, manufacturing, and technology policy.\n\nOther destinations are more sporadic. I have traveled to Indonesia to discuss potential investments. I visit wherever Starlink is launching major initiatives or where critical business discussions require my presence.\n\n## The Reality of Being Everywhere and Nowhere\n\nPeople ask where I am right now, and the honest answer is that I am always in motion. My phone and laptop are my constant companions. I am reading emails, reviewing documents, and participating in discussions whether I am in a car, on a plane, or walking between buildings at a factory.\n\nI have optimized my life for maximum productivity across multiple ventures. That means I do not have a traditional home life in the way most people understand it. My home is wherever the most critical work is happening. Right now, that is usually Texas, but it could shift if circumstances demand.\n\nThe Boring Company headquarters is in Austin. Neuralink is in Fremont, California. X, formerly Twitter, has offices in San Francisco. xAI has teams in multiple locations. Each of these requires my attention, and I allocate time based on urgency and importance.\n\n## Where You Might Spot Me in Public\n\nI am not a particularly public person in the sense of attending events for their own sake. But there are contexts where I am visible:\n\nRocket launches at Starbase attract crowds, and I am often present for major tests. SpaceX events and announcements typically feature me. Tesla shareholder meetings and product unveilings are obvious appearances. I occasionally attend conferences or accept awards when they align with my interests or provide platforms for ideas I want to promote.\n\nI use X (formerly Twitter) constantly. If you want to know what I am thinking about at any given moment, my posts are probably the best indicator. I share updates on SpaceX, Tesla, and other projects in real time. Sometimes I post memes. The platform gives me direct communication with millions of people without media intermediation.\n\n## Why My Location Matters Less Than My Focus\n\nUltimately, where I am physically matters less than what I am working on. The magic of modern technology is that I can participate in engineering discussions, approve designs, and make decisions from anywhere. Video calls connect me with teams across the globe. Documents and data flow continuously.\n\nBut physical presence still matters for certain things. You cannot truly understand manufacturing problems without walking the factory floor. You cannot inspire teams without being there in person during crucial moments. You cannot solve hard engineering problems without being in the room with the people who have their hands on the hardware.\n\nSo I move constantly between the places where my physical presence adds the most value. Right now, Texas is my center of gravity. Starbase is where the future is being built. Austin is where Tesla is scaling the Cybertruck and advancing towards full autonomy. These are the problems that demand my attention most urgently.\n\n## The Future: Where Will I Be?\n\nLooking ahead, my location priorities will continue to evolve. As Starship becomes operational, I expect to spend even more time at Starbase. The journey to Mars requires solving thousands of problems, and I intend to be personally involved in as many of those solutions as possible.\n\nIf Tesla fully achieves autonomous driving and robotaxi operations, my time allocation there may shift. If Neuralink achieves its breakthrough medical applications, I may need to be more present in California. If xAI makes rapid progress on artificial general intelligence, that could demand more of my attention.\n\nI go where I am needed most. Right now, that means Texas is my home, California is a regular destination, and the rest of the world sees me when critical work requires it. The one certainty is that I will keep moving, keep working, and keep pushing toward the future I believe we need to build.",
