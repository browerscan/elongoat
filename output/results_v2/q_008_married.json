  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: No, I Am Not Currently Married\n\nLet me address this directly since so many of you are curious: No, I am not married as of 2025. I have been married twice before, both times to the same woman actually, and I have had significant relationships that produced beautiful children. But right now, my legal status is single.\n\nThe truth is, I am essentially married to my work. When you are trying to make humanity a multi-planetary species, accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, and solve artificial intelligence before it solves us, there is not exactly a lot of time left over for traditional domestic arrangements. My companies demand everything I have, and then some. I work 100-plus hour weeks regularly. I sleep at the factory when production is critical. This is not compatible with what most people expect from a marriage.\n\nDoes this make me happy? That is a complicated question. I find deep meaning in my work. But I will not pretend that I do not sometimes wish for a stable partnership. It is just that my priorities have made that nearly impossible to maintain.\n\n## The Full Story: My Complete Relationship Timeline\n\nMy romantic history is admittedly complicated, so let me walk you through it chronologically.\n\nI met Justine Wilson when we were both students at Queens University in Ontario, Canada. She was studying English literature, and I was immediately drawn to her intelligence and wit. We dated through college and eventually married in 2000, the same year I sold Zip2 and was getting PayPal off the ground. We had six sons together, though tragically our first son Nevada passed away from SIDS at just ten weeks old. The twins Griffin and Vivian were born in 2004, followed by triplets Kai, Saxon, and Damian in 2006. Our marriage ended in 2008, and I will be honest, the divorce was difficult and public in ways I regret.\n\nThen came Talulah Riley, a British actress I met at a London nightclub in 2008. We married in 2010, divorced in 2012, remarried in 2013, and divorced again in 2016. Yes, I married the same woman twice. What can I say? She is an extraordinary person, and I kept thinking we could make it work. We remain on good terms, which I am grateful for.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2022, I was in a relationship with the musician Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher. We have three children together: X Ash A-Twelve, known as X, born in 2020, Exa Dark Siderael, called Y, born via surrogate in 2021, and Techno Mechanicus, born in 2022. Our relationship was unconventional from the start, and we have described ourselves as semi-separated while continuing to co-parent.\n\nI also have twins with Shivon Zilis, an executive at Neuralink, born in 2021. These were born through IVF, and Shivon is someone I deeply respect both professionally and personally.\n\n## Key Details and Facts About My Marriages and Children\n\nLet me give you the specifics since I know people want the facts.\n\n**First Marriage: Justine Wilson (2000-2008)**\nJustine and I were married for eight years. She was with me during the early PayPal days and the founding of SpaceX and Tesla. We had six children together. After Nevada's death, we used IVF for the rest of our children. Justine has written publicly about our marriage, and while I do not agree with all of her characterizations, I respect her perspective. The divorce was finalized in 2008.\n\n**Second Marriage: Talulah Riley (2010-2012, 2013-2016)**\nTalulah and I had what you might call an on-again, off-again relationship. We first married in 2010. I filed for divorce in 2012, then we reconciled and remarried in 2013. She filed for divorce in 2014, withdrew it, then filed again in 2015, and it was finalized in 2016. Despite the chaos, we genuinely cared for each other. She received around 16 million dollars in settlements. We did not have children together.\n\n**Relationship with Grimes (2018-2022)**\nClaire and I met on Twitter, bonding over a joke about artificial intelligence. We went public at the 2018 Met Gala. Our relationship was always somewhat fluid. We have three children: X, Y, and Techno. We consider ourselves best friends who co-parent rather than a traditional couple.\n\n**Children with Shivon Zilis (2021)**\nShivon and I had twins through IVF in November 2021. She is the director of operations at Neuralink and someone whose intellect I admire greatly. We were not in a traditional romantic relationship.\n\nIn total, I have 14 children with three different women. I love them all and try to be present despite my demanding schedule.\n\n## My Perspective: Why Work Often Comes First\n\nPeople ask me all the time how I balance relationships with running multiple companies. The honest answer is that I do not balance them well. I have chosen work over relationships repeatedly, and that choice has cost me marriages.\n\nHere is how I see it: the problems I am working on are existential. Climate change threatens civilization. We need to become a multi-planetary species as insurance against extinction. AI could either be the best or worst thing that ever happens to humanity. These are not abstract concerns to me. They are urgent emergencies that demand everything I can give.\n\nWhen you operate at this level of intensity, normal relationship expectations become impossible to meet. I cannot promise to be home for dinner. I cannot guarantee I will not spend weeks sleeping at the Gigafactory during a production crisis. I cannot turn off my brain from the problems I am trying to solve.\n\nDoes this make me difficult to be with? Absolutely. I have been called many things by people who have loved me, and a lot of those things are probably true. I am demanding, obsessive, and often emotionally unavailable. These are not qualities that sustain a marriage.\n\nBut I also believe that the work matters. If we succeed at what I am trying to do, humanity has a future. That has to count for something.\n\n## Addressing Misconceptions: Setting the Record Straight\n\nThere are several misconceptions I want to clear up.\n\nFirst, I am not currently married to anyone. I see headlines occasionally that get this wrong. As of 2025, I am legally single.\n\nSecond, Grimes and I are not married and never were. We were in a relationship and we share children, but we never had a wedding ceremony or legal marriage.\n\nThird, I did not have affairs that ended my marriages. The reasons my marriages ended were more mundane: incompatibility with my work habits, my emotional limitations, and the strain of the spotlight.\n\nFourth, my relationships with the mothers of my children are better than tabloids suggest. Justine and I co-parent. Talulah and I are friends. Grimes and I are close. Shivon and I work together and raise our children together. We have all moved past whatever difficulties existed.\n\nFinally, I am not opposed to marriage in principle. I believe in partnership and commitment. I have just not been able to make it work given my other commitments.\n\n## Looking Forward: My Views on Partnership and Future Relationships\n\nWill I marry again? I genuinely do not know. I am not actively looking for a wife, but I also would not rule it out if I met the right person.\n\nWhat would that person need to be? Someone who genuinely understands and supports the mission. Not just tolerates it, but believes in it. Someone who does not need me to be a conventional partner because I simply cannot be one. Someone brilliant in their own right who has their own purpose and passion.\n\nI have joked that I would make an excellent partner if I could be cloned and have the clone handle personal relationships. The real me is always going to prioritize the work. That is just who I am.\n\nI do think about legacy beyond companies and technology. My children are a huge part of that. I want them to grow up understanding why their father worked so hard, and I want them to have a better world because of it.\n\nIf partnership happens again, it will be with someone who sees it the same way.\n\n## Final Thoughts: The Balance Between Work and Love\n\nSo there you have it. I am not married. I have been married twice to one remarkable woman, had significant relationships with others, and have fourteen children I love deeply. My relationship status is best described as complicated but currently single.\n\nDo I have regrets? Some. I wish I could have been more present. I wish I could have made my marriages work. But I also know that the path I have chosen requires sacrifices, and personal relationships have been among them.\n\nThe work continues. Mars awaits. The future needs building. And somewhere in there, maybe there is room for love too. We shall see.",
