  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: I Moved to America in 1992\n\nI moved to America in 1992 when I was 21 years old. I arrived in the United States to attend the University of Pennsylvania after first spending approximately two years in Canada. The specific date was in the fall of 1992, when I transferred to UPenn's Wharton School and the College of Arts and Sciences to pursue a double major in economics and physics.\n\nLet me be precise about the timeline because people often conflate my departure from South Africa with my arrival in America. I left South Africa in June 1989, just before turning 18, and went to Canada first. America came three years later. That distinction matters because those Canadian years were formative, teaching me the kind of resilience that would prove essential for everything that followed.\n\n## Why I Left South Africa in the First Place\n\nPeople ask me all the time why I left South Africa. The answer has multiple layers, but the simplest explanation is that I wanted to be in America. From the time I was a kid, I saw the United States as the land where great things were possible. The technology, the culture, the sheer ambition of the place called to me. South Africa in the 1980s felt like a dead end for someone who wanted to build the future.\n\nThere were practical concerns too. Mandatory military service was coming, and I had no desire to support the apartheid system by serving in the South African army. The political situation was toxic. The economy was constrained by sanctions. And frankly, I was getting beaten up regularly at school. South Africa was not a place where I could thrive.\n\nMy mother, Maye, was born in Canada, which meant I had a path to Canadian citizenship. That became my gateway to North America. The plan was always to eventually get to America, but Canada was the stepping stone that made it possible.\n\n## The Canadian Detour: 1989 to 1992\n\nI landed in Canada in June 1989 with very little money and even less certainty about my immediate future. My first stop was supposed to be a great-uncle in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, but he had moved to Minnesota a year earlier. Nobody told me. I spent time doing odd jobs, crashing with distant relatives, and learning what it meant to be truly on my own.\n\nThose Canadian years were not glamorous. I worked at a lumber mill. I cleaned out the boiler room at a lumber mill, which was filthy, dangerous work. I shoveled grain. I cut logs. I did whatever was necessary to survive and save money for education. At one point, I was earning about $18 per hour cleaning boiler rooms, which was good money, but the work was brutal. You had to wear a hazmat suit and crawl through tunnels that were still hot from the steam.\n\nI enrolled at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, in 1990. The choice was strategic. Queen's had a good reputation, and more importantly, it was affordable. I studied there for two years, taking courses in business and physics, always with my eye on the next step: transferring to an American university.\n\nDuring my time at Queen's, I met some incredible people. My first serious girlfriend was there. I made friends who challenged my thinking. But I also knew Queen's was not my final destination. America was still the goal.\n\n## Arriving at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992\n\nIn the fall of 1992, I transferred to the University of Pennsylvania. This was the moment I had been working toward since I was a kid reading science fiction in Pretoria. I was finally in America.\n\nWhy UPenn? The combination of the Wharton School for business and a strong physics program was unique. I wanted to understand both how the world works (physics) and how business works (economics). At the time, I was not sure exactly what I would do with that combination, but I knew I wanted to build things, and building things at scale required understanding both domains.\n\nI arrived at Penn with the typical immigrant mindset: work harder than everyone else because you have no safety net. I did not have wealthy parents writing checks. I had scholarships and student loans and the money I had saved from those Canadian odd jobs. Every opportunity felt precious because I knew how easily it could be taken away.\n\nThe campus itself was a revelation. Here was this historic institution in Philadelphia, surrounded by people who had come from all over the world to learn and create. The energy was completely different from anything I had experienced in South Africa or Canada. People talked about startups. They talked about changing industries. The dot-com boom was still a few years away, but you could feel something building.\n\nI lived in a house off campus with other students. We threw parties that became somewhat notorious on campus, which helped me develop social skills that had been lacking during my miserable childhood in South Africa. I started to understand that success required not just technical ability but the capacity to connect with people, to sell ideas, to build teams.\n\n## My Double Major and Academic Life\n\nAt Penn, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Economics from Wharton and a Bachelor of Arts in Physics from the College of Arts and Sciences. This was not a common path. Most Wharton students focused exclusively on business. But I was not interested in being most Wharton students.\n\nPhysics taught me first principles thinking. Instead of reasoning by analogy, which is how most people operate, physics forces you to boil things down to fundamental truths and build up from there. This approach would later prove essential at SpaceX when we needed to figure out why rockets cost so much and whether those costs were actually necessary.\n\nEconomics and business gave me the frameworks to understand markets, capital allocation, and organizational behavior. I learned about game theory, market structures, and how incentives shape behavior. Wharton's network also proved valuable, though I did not fully appreciate it at the time.\n\nI graduated in 1997 with both degrees. By then, I had already been accepted to a PhD program in energy physics at Stanford University. But I would defer that admission and never actually attend. The internet was exploding, and I was not going to sit in a lab while the future was being built in Silicon Valley.\n\n## What America Meant to Me\n\nPeople sometimes ask whether coming to America lived up to my expectations. The answer is complicated. America is both better and worse than the mythology suggests. The opportunity is real. The ability to reinvent yourself, to be judged on what you can do rather than where you came from, that is genuinely powerful. But America also has deep problems: inequality, polarization, crumbling infrastructure in many places.\n\nWhat I found in America was exactly what I was looking for: a place where ambitious people come to build things. Silicon Valley, which I discovered after leaving Penn, was the epicenter of this energy. Here were people who genuinely believed they could change the world, and many of them actually did. This attitude was infectious.\n\nAmerica also gave me something I did not have in South Africa: physical safety. I was not getting beaten up anymore. I was not facing mandatory military service for a government I despised. I could focus entirely on building rather than surviving. That psychological freedom is hard to overstate.\n\n## The Path from UPenn to Entrepreneur\n\nAfter graduating from Penn in 1997, I moved to Silicon Valley. I had planned to pursue the PhD at Stanford, but I deferred admission to start a company with my brother Kimbal. The internet was clearly going to transform everything, and I wanted to be part of that transformation rather than reading about it from a physics lab.\n\nZip2 was born in a small office in Palo Alto. We built online city guides for newspapers, essentially Google Maps before Google Maps existed. We coded through the night, slept on beanbags at the office, and showered at the YMCA. It was miserable and exhilarating at the same time.\n\nCompaq acquired Zip2 in 1999 for approximately $307 million. I was 27 years old and suddenly had $22 million. But the money was almost beside the point. What mattered was the validation that I could actually build something valuable in America. The immigrant bet had paid off.\n\nFrom there came X.com, which merged with Confinity to become PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002. Then SpaceX. Then Tesla. Then everything else. But none of it would have been possible if I had stayed in South Africa, or if I had been content with Canada. America was always the destination because America is where the future gets built.\n\n## Becoming an American Citizen\n\nI became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002. This was about a decade after arriving in America. The citizenship ceremony was meaningful to me in a way that might surprise people who know me as someone skeptical of government bureaucracy. But citizenship is different. It represents belonging to this experiment called America.\n\nBy the time I was sworn in as a citizen, I had already founded two companies and was preparing to start SpaceX. I was committed to this country in every possible way. The citizenship paperwork just made it official.\n\nToday, when people ask about my nationality, I consider myself American. I was born in South Africa. I have Canadian citizenship through my mother. But my identity, my work, my life is here. I am American by choice, which I think means something different than being American by birth. I chose this country because I believed in what it represents, and I have spent my career trying to contribute to its future.\n\n## Looking Back on 1992\n\nMore than three decades have passed since I arrived at UPenn in 1992. I was a skinny 21-year-old with a weird accent, no money, and enormous ambitions. I had no idea whether any of it would work out.\n\nLooking back, the decision to come to America was the most important decision of my life. Everything else flows from that choice. SpaceX exists because America has the regulatory environment, the talent pool, and the risk appetite to support a private rocket company. Tesla exists because America has the entrepreneurial ecosystem that allows companies to challenge established industries. None of this would have been possible in South Africa or Canada.\n\nI often tell young people from other countries who want to build things: come to America if you can. The visa process is frustrating, the immigration system needs reform, and the bureaucracy can be maddening. But if you want to work on the most ambitious problems with the most talented people, this is still the place to be.\n\nWhen did I move to America? Fall of 1992, to attend the University of Pennsylvania. But the journey really started when I was a kid in Pretoria, dreaming about rockets and computers and a country across the ocean where people built the future instead of just talking about it.\n\n## The Importance of Timing\n\nOne thing I have thought about over the years is how lucky I was with timing. I arrived in America just as the internet was about to transform everything. If I had come a decade earlier, the opportunities would have been different. A decade later, and I would have missed the formative years of the digital revolution.\n\nArriving at Penn in 1992 meant I graduated in 1997, right when the dot-com boom was accelerating. The timing was almost perfect for starting an internet company. This was not pure luck; I had been following technology trends and positioning myself. But there was definitely an element of being in the right place at the right time.\n\nThis is why I tell people not to wait for perfect conditions. You cannot predict exactly when opportunities will emerge. But you can put yourself in environments where opportunities are more likely to appear. For me, that meant getting to America, getting to Silicon Valley, and being ready to act when the moment came.",
