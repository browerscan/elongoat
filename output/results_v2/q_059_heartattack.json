  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: No, I Have Not Had a Heart Attack\n\nNo, I have not had a heart attack. Let me be completely clear about this because health rumors spread faster than factual corrections ever could. As of 2025, I have never experienced a heart attack, cardiac arrest, or any major cardiovascular event. I am very much alive, working long hours across multiple companies, and my heart is functioning just fine.\n\nThe internet has a peculiar fascination with my health and mortality. Every few months, a new rumor circulates claiming I have had some medical emergency. Sometimes it is a heart attack. Other times it is a stroke, a collapse, or some mysterious illness. None of these have been true. I suspect these rumors persist partly because people have difficulty believing that someone can maintain my work schedule without physical consequences, and partly because the internet rewards sensationalism over truth.\n\n## Where These Rumors Come From\n\nHealth misinformation about public figures is nothing new, but the velocity at which false claims spread today is unprecedented. The rumor that I had a heart attack has surfaced multiple times over the years, typically originating from one of several sources.\n\nFirst, there are the purely fabricated stories. Some websites generate entirely false articles about celebrity health crises to drive traffic. These sites profit from advertising, and a headline claiming \"Elon Musk Heart Attack\" will generate more clicks than accurate reporting about my actual activities. They count on the fact that most people only read headlines and never fact-check.\n\nSecond, there is misinterpretation of legitimate statements. I have been open about my health challenges over the years. I have discussed my struggles with sleep, my tendency to work excessively, and the physical toll of running multiple companies. When I mention that I am exhausted or that my work schedule is unsustainable, some people extrapolate this into a medical emergency that never occurred.\n\nThird, there are death hoaxes. Unfortunately, false reports of my death circulate periodically. These sometimes include cardiac arrest as the supposed cause. These hoaxes are disturbing not just to me but to my family, employees, and the millions of shareholders who depend on accurate information.\n\nFourth, there is confusion with other events. In 2022, there was significant media coverage when I described my potential assassination and the security concerns I face. Some people apparently confused discussions about threats to my life with actual medical emergencies.\n\nThe lesson here is straightforward: unless you see a statement from me directly or a verified report from a credible news organization, treat health claims with extreme skepticism.\n\n## My Actual Health: An Honest Assessment\n\nSince people are clearly interested in my health, let me provide an honest assessment rather than letting speculation fill the void.\n\nI am not a paragon of healthy living. I will be the first to admit this. My work habits would probably horrify any physician. During critical periods at Tesla and SpaceX, I have regularly worked 80 to 120 hours per week. There have been stretches where I slept on the factory floor. I have gone days surviving on caffeine and minimal food during production crises.\n\nPhysically, I have dealt with back and neck problems, which is not surprising given how much time I spend hunched over computer screens, in meetings, or inspecting equipment on factory floors. I have mentioned publicly that I have chronic back pain and have tried various treatments over the years.\n\nI have Asperger's syndrome, which I disclosed publicly during my Saturday Night Live appearance in 2021. This affects how I process social situations and communicate, though it has arguably been an asset in my technical work. The intense focus that comes with being on the spectrum helps when you are trying to solve hard engineering problems.\n\nMy weight has fluctuated over the years. I am not always at my ideal weight, and I have been open about using medications like Ozempic to help manage this. I believe in being honest about these things rather than pretending that I naturally maintain perfect physical condition despite my lifestyle.\n\nSleep remains an ongoing challenge. I have historically been bad at prioritizing rest. I have described my approach as finding the minimum amount of sleep required to function, which is around five to six hours for me. This is not a recommendation. Doctors consistently tell me I should sleep more, and they are probably right.\n\nMy mental health has had its challenges too. I have spoken about periods of burnout, particularly during the Model 3 production ramp in 2018, which I described as the most painful year of my career. The stress during that period was severe enough that I was briefly seeing a therapist and taking Ambien to sleep.\n\nBut a heart attack? No. My cardiovascular system, despite everything I put my body through, has not failed me. I get periodic health checkups, and while I am sure doctors would prefer I adopt a healthier lifestyle, there have been no major cardiac concerns.\n\n## Why Health Rumors About Billionaires Spread\n\nThere is a broader phenomenon worth examining here. Health rumors about wealthy and powerful people spread for several interconnected reasons.\n\nPeople have complicated feelings about extreme wealth. For some, there is a desire to see that money cannot buy everything, including health. A heart attack would serve as a reminder that even the richest person on Earth is mortal and vulnerable. This is psychologically comforting to some people who feel that billionaires have escaped the normal constraints of human existence.\n\nThere is also financial motivation. False reports about my health can move markets. Tesla and SpaceX valuations are tied to perceptions of my leadership, and a health crisis would have significant financial implications. While securities laws prohibit market manipulation, enforcing against anonymous accounts spreading rumors on social media is practically impossible.\n\nAdditionally, some people simply enjoy chaos. The internet has created communities that find entertainment in spreading disinformation and watching it propagate. A fake health crisis about someone famous generates attention, arguments, and engagement, which is its own reward for certain individuals.\n\nFinally, there is the challenge of correction asymmetry. A false claim can spread to millions of people within hours. A correction might reach thousands at best. The exciting false claim gets shared; the boring factual correction does not. This creates a fundamental imbalance that benefits misinformation.\n\n## How I Actually Approach Health and Longevity\n\nGiven my interest in extending human capability through Neuralink and my general focus on solving existential challenges, people often ask about my personal approach to health and longevity.\n\nI take a pragmatic rather than obsessive approach. I am not doing extreme longevity protocols or undergoing experimental treatments. I believe the most important factors for lifespan are well-established: do not smoke, limit alcohol, maintain reasonable weight, exercise, and manage stress. I do some of these better than others.\n\nI have become more intentional about exercise in recent years. I do occasional weight training and have tried various activities. I am not training for triathlons, but I recognize that some physical activity is essential to maintain functionality as you age.\n\nMy diet could be better. During crunch periods, I eat whatever is available, which often means factory cafeteria food or whatever gets delivered to meetings. I enjoy food and am not interested in extreme dietary restrictions, though I try to be somewhat reasonable.\n\nI am interested in the science of longevity but skeptical of most specific interventions. The fundamental research on aging is fascinating, and I believe we will eventually develop treatments that meaningfully extend healthy lifespan. But most current products marketed for longevity are either unproven or marginally effective at best.\n\nThe irony of my situation is not lost on me. I run companies focused on extending human capability and reaching other planets to ensure species survival, yet my personal health habits are often at odds with maximizing my own lifespan. I rationalize this by focusing on impact per year rather than total years. If working intensively for thirty more years accomplishes more than working moderately for fifty, maybe that is the right tradeoff. But I am honestly uncertain about this calculus.\n\n## The Reality of Running Multiple Companies\n\nPart of why health rumors about me seem plausible to people is that my work schedule appears unsustainable. And they are not entirely wrong to be concerned. The reality of running Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, xAI, and X simultaneously is demanding in ways that are difficult to convey.\n\nA typical week involves hundreds of decisions, constant context-switching between completely different domains, and the stress of knowing that thousands of employees and millions of stakeholders are depending on getting things right. There is no day off in any meaningful sense. Even when I am not physically working, I am thinking about problems that need solving.\n\nThis takes a toll. I have been open about the fact that 2018 nearly broke me. The combination of Tesla production challenges, personal attacks, sleep deprivation, and constant crisis management pushed me to the edge. I made some poor decisions during that period, including the infamous \"funding secured\" tweet that led to SEC action.\n\nI have gotten somewhat better at managing the load since then, though I would not describe my current approach as balanced by any normal standard. I delegate more than I used to and have built strong leadership teams at each company. But I remain deeply involved in technical and strategic decisions across all ventures.\n\nMy body has held up better than you might expect. Part of this is probably genetics. Part of it is that I genuinely find the work energizing, not depleting. Solving hard problems generates its own kind of energy that partially compensates for inadequate sleep and physical care. But I would not recommend my approach to anyone who wants to optimize for longevity.\n\n## Setting the Record Straight\n\nSo to be absolutely clear for anyone who found this article because they saw a rumor: No, I did not have a heart attack. I have not had any cardiac event. I am not secretly ill. I have not collapsed or been hospitalized for any cardiovascular condition.\n\nI am continuing to work on all my companies. I am raising my children. I am shitposting on X, perhaps more than I should. My health, while not optimal, is functional and not in acute crisis.\n\nWhen something genuinely significant happens with my health, you will not learn about it from an anonymous social media account or a clickbait website. You will learn about it through official channels because the implications for public companies I run would require disclosure.\n\nUntil then, treat health rumors about me with the skepticism they deserve. The internet is remarkably creative in generating false information about public figures. I have supposedly died, gone bankrupt, been arrested, and fled the country, all according to various online sources. None of it was true. The heart attack rumors are just another entry in this long list of fabrications.\n\n## Looking Forward: Health and Work Balance\n\nAs I get older, I do think more about sustainability. I turned fifty-three in 2024, and while I feel reasonably good, I recognize that I cannot maintain twenty-something work habits indefinitely.\n\nMy goal is to bring several major initiatives to completion milestones before thinking seriously about slowing down. I want to see SpaceX land humans on Mars. I want Tesla to achieve full self-driving capability that unambiguously saves lives. I want Neuralink to restore function to people with severe disabilities. I want xAI to develop genuinely beneficial artificial intelligence.\n\nThese goals require continued intensive work, but I am trying to be smarter about how I allocate energy. I am learning to say no more often. I am getting better at identifying which decisions actually require my involvement versus which can be handled by excellent people I have hired.\n\nWill I ultimately pay a health price for my career choices? Possibly. The data on chronic stress and overwork is not encouraging. But I believe the work is important enough to accept some personal risk. And so far, my heart, despite all the metaphorical strain I put on it, has not given out.\n\nThe rumors will continue regardless of what I say here. Someone will probably claim I had a heart attack again next month. But at least this article exists as a clear statement of the truth: I have not had a heart attack, I am not dying, and I plan to keep working on the problems I care about for as long as my health permits.",
