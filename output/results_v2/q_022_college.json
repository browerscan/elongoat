  "answer": "## Yes, I Went to College - And Earned Two Degrees\n\nLet me clear this up right away: yes, I absolutely went to college. In fact, I have two bachelor's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania - one in physics and one in economics. The confusion often comes from the fact that I dropped out of Stanford's PhD program after just two days, which somehow morphed into this myth that I'm a college dropout who built an empire from nothing. The reality is more nuanced and, I think, more interesting.\n\nI spent five years in higher education across two continents, and while I have complex feelings about traditional education systems, my university experience was formative in ways I couldn't have predicted at the time.\n\n## The Full Story: From Pretoria to Philadelphia\n\n### Queen's University: My Canadian Gateway\n\nMy college journey began in 1989 at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. I was 17 years old, fresh from South Africa, and determined to eventually make my way to the United States where the real innovation in technology was happening. Canada was my stepping stone - it was easier to immigrate there first, partly because my mother was born in Canada.\n\nQueen's was a solid school, and I spent two years there studying. It wasn't Stanford or MIT, but it served its purpose. I was reading everything I could get my hands on, way beyond the curriculum. The dormitory experience, the access to books, the discussions with other students - these were valuable. But I knew it wasn't my final destination.\n\n### Transfer to University of Pennsylvania\n\nAfter two years at Queen's, I transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. This was the big league I'd been aiming for. Penn is an Ivy League institution with serious academic credibility, and I pursued a dual degree through the coordinated dual-degree program.\n\nI graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Science in Physics from Penn's College of Arts and Sciences and a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the Wharton School. Yes, Wharton - the same business school that everyone talks about. Though honestly, I was much more interested in the physics and technology side of things.\n\nThe physics degree taught me how to think from first principles, to break down complex problems to their fundamental truths and reason up from there. This approach has been absolutely crucial to everything I've done since - from rockets to electric cars to neural interfaces.\n\nThe economics degree from Wharton gave me frameworks for understanding markets, capital allocation, and business systems. Did I need a Wharton degree to start businesses? Probably not. Was it useful? Absolutely.\n\n### Stanford: The 48-Hour PhD\n\nIn 1995, I was accepted into Stanford's PhD program in materials science and physics. This was the dream, right? Stanford, right in the heart of Silicon Valley, studying advanced physics. I moved to California, found an apartment, showed up for a couple of days, and then... I left.\n\nIt was 1995. The internet was exploding. Netscape had just gone public. I could literally see the future being built in real-time, and I was sitting in a classroom. The opportunity cost of doing a PhD for the next several years while the internet revolution passed me by was too high.\n\nI had this idea for what would become Zip2, my first company. My brother Kimbal and I had about $28,000 between us. We rented a small office, got one computer, and slept in the office because we couldn't afford an apartment and office rent. We showered at the YMCA.\n\nSo yes, I'm technically a \"Stanford dropout,\" but I'd already completed two full degrees. There's a big difference between dropping out of a PhD program at 24 after earning two bachelor's degrees and dropping out of undergrad at 19.\n\n## Key Educational Details\n\n### My Two Bachelor's Degrees\n\n**Physics (University of Pennsylvania)**\n- Graduated 1995\n- Focus: Understanding fundamental principles of how the universe works\n- Why it matters: First principles thinking, problem-solving methodology\n- Application: Rocket science at SpaceX, battery technology at Tesla, physics of tunneling at Boring Company\n\n**Economics - Wharton School (University of Pennsylvania)**\n- Graduated 1995\n- Focus: Market systems, business fundamentals, capital allocation\n- Why it matters: Understanding how to build sustainable businesses\n- Application: Every company I've started or scaled\n\n### The Stanford Chapter\n\n- Accepted: PhD program, Materials Science and Applied Physics, 1995\n- Duration: 2 days\n- Reason for leaving: Internet boom, opportunity cost too high\n- Official status: Leave of absence (later converted to withdrawal)\n\nThe Stanford situation gets misrepresented a lot. I didn't get kicked out. I wasn't failing. I made a calculated decision that building internet companies in 1995 was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that couldn't wait.\n\n## My Perspective on Traditional Education\n\n### What College Got Right for Me\n\nLet me be clear: I don't regret going to college. The physics program especially taught me how to think, not just what to think. Learning to break complex problems down to first principles and reason up from there - that's invaluable.\n\nCollege also provided:\n- Access to concentrated knowledge and expert professors\n- Peer networks and intellectual sparring partners\n- Structured learning in foundational subjects\n- Time and space to read extensively\n- Credibility that helped in early fundraising\n\n### What College Got Wrong\n\nThat said, universities are optimized for the wrong things. Too much focus on memorization, not enough on problem-solving. Too much theory without practical application. The pace is glacially slow for motivated learners.\n\nThe real learning happened outside the classroom - in the books I read independently, the projects I worked on, the problems I tried to solve. I probably learned more from reading than from lectures.\n\n### The Internet Changed Everything\n\nHere's the thing: when I went to college in the early 1990s, universities were still the best place to access information and expertise. Today? You can learn almost anything online for free or cheap. MIT OpenCourseWare, Khan Academy, YouTube tutorials, technical papers - it's all there.\n\nYou don't need college to learn. You need college for the credential, the network, and maybe the structured motivation if you're not self-directed.\n\n### Self-Learning Is Underrated\n\nI taught myself rocket science. Not from a degree program, but from reading textbooks. When I decided to start SpaceX in 2002, I didn't go back to school for aerospace engineering. I read books. Lots of books. Fundamentals of Astrodynamics, Rocket Propulsion Elements, Aerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion - I basically consumed a curriculum's worth of aerospace engineering textbooks.\n\nThe same approach applied to manufacturing, materials science, software engineering, and every other domain I needed to understand. Find the best textbooks, read them carefully, talk to experts, and apply the knowledge to real problems.\n\n## Common Misconceptions About My Education\n\n### Myth 1: \"Elon Musk is a college dropout billionaire\"\n\nNo. I have two bachelor's degrees from an Ivy League university. I dropped out of a PhD program, which is completely different. I'd already spent five years in higher education and earned two degrees.\n\nThe \"dropout billionaire\" narrative fits a nice story arc, but it's not accurate. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg - they dropped out of undergraduate programs. I completed my undergrad education.\n\n### Myth 2: \"He succeeded despite not going to college\"\n\nI succeeded in part because of the foundational knowledge I gained in college, combined with extensive self-learning and practical application. It's not either-or.\n\n### Myth 3: \"You don't need college to be successful\"\n\nThis is complicated. Do you technically need a college degree to be successful? No, especially in today's world. But does it help? Often, yes.\n\nFor most people, college provides structure, credentials, and networks that are genuinely useful. Not everyone is in a position to teach themselves everything or to take the risks required for entrepreneurship.\n\nMy advice: if you can learn what you need without college, and you have a clear path forward, maybe skip it or do it part-time. But don't drop out just because some billionaires did. Most of them would tell you they succeeded despite dropping out, not because of it.\n\n### Myth 4: \"He thinks traditional education is useless\"\n\nI don't think education is useless - I think our current education system is inefficient and often teaches the wrong things. There's a huge difference.\n\nI'm not against learning. I'm against a system that prioritizes credentials over competence, memorization over understanding, and theory over practical problem-solving.\n\n## Looking Forward: Rethinking Education\n\n### Ad Astra School\n\nI actually created a small school called Ad Astra (now Astra Nova) for my kids and some SpaceX employees' children. No grades separating students by age. Focus on problem-solving, critical thinking, and skills that actually matter.\n\nInstead of treating all students the same, we let them progress at their own pace in different subjects. Someone might be advanced in math but need more time with writing. The traditional system of grade levels makes no sense.\n\n### What I'd Change About Universities\n\n1. **Make it more hands-on**: Every physics or engineering class should involve building something\n2. **Accelerate the pace**: Motivated students can learn much faster than the standard curriculum allows\n3. **Focus on problem-solving**: Give students real problems to solve, not just equations to memorize\n4. **Teach relevant skills**: AI, coding, critical thinking - not just theory from decades ago\n5. **Make it affordable**: The cost of higher education is absurd relative to the value provided\n\n### Hiring Without Degrees at My Companies\n\nAt Tesla and SpaceX, we don't require college degrees. We care about ability and contribution. Some of our best engineers never went to college. Some have PhDs. What matters is: can you solve hard problems?\n\nThat said, many of our employees do have degrees, often from top schools. Degrees can signal capability and provide foundational knowledge. But they're not a requirement.\n\n## Final Thoughts: The College Question\n\nSo, did I go to college? Yes, absolutely. Two degrees, five years, from Queen's University and University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWas it necessary for my success? The physics degree and the thinking skills it taught me - probably yes. The specific economics coursework - probably not, though the general business knowledge helped.\n\nWould I do it again? Probably, but I'd approach it differently. I'd focus more on first principles learning, less on grades. I'd do more practical projects. I'd probably finish faster.\n\nShould you go to college? That depends entirely on your goals, learning style, financial situation, and the specific opportunities available to you. It's not a universal answer.\n\nWhat I do know: education matters enormously. But education and schooling are not the same thing. Never stop learning, whether that's in a classroom or from books or from trying to solve hard problems. The source of knowledge matters less than your ability to absorb it and apply it to make things better.\n\nThe world needs people who can think critically, solve complex problems, and build things that matter. Whether you get those skills from MIT or from teaching yourself is secondary to whether you actually develop them and put them to use.\n\nNow, back to building rockets and electric cars.",
