  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: Yes, I Am South African by Birth\n\nYes, I am South African. I was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. This is where my story begins, and it shaped who I became in ways that are often overlooked when people talk about me as an American tech billionaire.\n\nLet me be absolutely clear about this: I spent the first seventeen years of my life in South Africa. I grew up there, went to school there, experienced the complex realities of that country during the apartheid era, and left for Canada in 1989. My South African roots are not just a footnote in my biography. They are fundamental to understanding my worldview, my work ethic, and why I think the way I do.\n\n## Growing Up in Pretoria: My South African Childhood\n\nPretoria is not just any city in South Africa. It is one of the three capitals, serving as the administrative seat of government. Growing up there in the 1970s and 1980s meant living through a turbulent period in South African history. Apartheid was the law of the land, and the international community was increasingly isolating the country through sanctions and boycotts.\n\nMy father, Errol Musk, was an electromechanical engineer. My mother, Maye Musk, was a dietitian and model who later became famous in her own right. They divorced when I was nine years old, and my younger brother Kimbal and I eventually chose to live with our father, while my sister Tosca stayed with our mother. This was a decision I have spoken about with some complexity over the years.\n\nThe South Africa of my childhood was a place of contradictions. There was extraordinary natural beauty, a certain frontier spirit, and opportunities for entrepreneurship that my father took advantage of. But there was also violence, uncertainty, and a social system that was fundamentally unjust. I was acutely aware of all of this growing up.\n\nI attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and later Bryanston High School and Pretoria Boys High School. My school years were difficult, and I do not romanticize them. I was bullied severely, once beaten so badly that I was hospitalized. South African schools in that era could be brutal places, and being a bookish kid who was more interested in computers and reading than sports made me a target.\n\n## My Formative Years: Books, Computers, and Dreams of Space\n\nWhat South Africa gave me, despite the difficulties, was time to think and read. I was an obsessive reader. I would go to bookstores and libraries and devour everything I could find. Science fiction especially captured my imagination. Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, Douglas Adams, and countless other authors shaped my thinking about the future of humanity.\n\nI also discovered computers. In 1983, when I was twelve years old, I taught myself programming and created a video game called Blastar, which I sold to a computer magazine for about five hundred dollars. This was my first taste of entrepreneurship and technology combined.\n\nThe isolation of South Africa due to international sanctions actually worked in my favor in one sense. We did not have access to the latest video games and consumer technology that kids in America or Europe had. So I built things instead. I experimented. I learned by doing.\n\nBut I also knew, from a relatively young age, that South Africa was not where I wanted to build my future. The mandatory military service loomed ahead, and I had no desire to serve in an army that was enforcing apartheid. More fundamentally, if I wanted to be at the center of technology and space exploration, I needed to be in America. The United States was where the action was.\n\n## Leaving South Africa: The Decision That Changed Everything\n\nIn 1989, at seventeen years old, I left South Africa for Canada. Why Canada? Because my mother had Canadian citizenship, which meant I could obtain Canadian citizenship relatively easily. And Canada, I knew, was a stepping stone to the United States.\n\nI arrived in Canada with very little money. I worked various jobs, including at a lumber mill and cleaning out the boiler room of a lumber yard. These were not glamorous experiences, but they taught me that I was willing to do whatever it took to build the life I envisioned.\n\nAfter attending Queens University in Ontario for two years, I transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, which brought me to America in 1992. I completed dual bachelor's degrees in physics and economics at Penn, then briefly attended Stanford for a PhD program in energy physics before dropping out to start Zip2 with my brother Kimbal. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut here is what people miss when they call me an American entrepreneur: I was twenty when I arrived in the United States. My personality, my work ethic, my worldview, my tolerance for risk and hardship, all of this was forged in South Africa. The American system gave me opportunities, but South Africa made me who I am.\n\n## My Citizenship Status: South African, Canadian, American\n\nLet me clarify my citizenship status because people often get confused about this. I hold three citizenships:\n\n**South African citizenship:** By birth. I was born in Pretoria and remained a South African citizen. I have never renounced this citizenship.\n\n**Canadian citizenship:** Through my mother, Maye Musk, who was born in Canada. I obtained this in 1989 when I moved to Canada at age seventeen.\n\n**American citizenship:** Naturalized in 2002. I became an American citizen after living in the United States for years and building my early companies here.\n\nSo when people ask if I am South African, the answer is unequivocally yes. I am also Canadian. And I am also American. These are not contradictions. They are layers of identity that reflect my journey.\n\n## How South Africa Shaped My Thinking\n\nGrowing up in South Africa during apartheid gave me certain perspectives that I carry to this day. First, I learned that systems that seem permanent can collapse. The apartheid regime looked unshakeable, but it fell. This informs my belief that even seemingly impossible changes, like transitioning the world to sustainable energy or making humanity multi-planetary, are achievable.\n\nSecond, I developed a certain comfort with uncertainty and chaos. South Africa was not a stable, predictable environment. You learned to adapt, to be resourceful, to not expect institutions to solve your problems. This served me well as an entrepreneur.\n\nThird, the physical environment of Africa itself gave me a sense of scale. The continent is vast. The skies are enormous. There is a rawness to the landscape that makes you think about big things, about evolution, about time scales beyond human civilization. I think this contributed to my interest in existential questions about humanity's future.\n\nI should also mention that South Africa has a strong engineering culture, particularly in mining and resource extraction. My father was an engineer, and that technical mindset was in the air. Building things, fixing things, understanding how machines work, this was valued in a way that perhaps it is not always valued in more service-oriented economies.\n\n## The South African Entrepreneurial Spirit\n\nSouth Africa has produced a disproportionate number of successful entrepreneurs, and I do not think this is accidental. When you grow up in a country with significant challenges, uncertainty, and limited resources, you develop a certain scrappiness. You learn to see opportunities where others see obstacles.\n\nMy cousin Lyndon Rive, also South African, co-founded SolarCity with me. The Collison brothers who founded Stripe are not South African, but they have that same immigrant hunger. There is something about coming from a place that is not the center of power that makes you willing to work harder and take bigger risks.\n\nI have hired many South Africans at my companies over the years. There is a work ethic and a directness that I appreciate. We tend to be less concerned with political correctness and more focused on getting things done. This is not always comfortable for everyone, but it is effective.\n\n## My Relationship with South Africa Today\n\nI left South Africa in 1989 and I have not lived there since. My focus has been on building companies in America because that is where the opportunities to pursue my goals existed. SpaceX could not have been built in South Africa. Tesla could not have achieved what it has outside of the American market.\n\nBut I maintain my South African citizenship, and the country remains part of my identity. When people ask where I am from, the honest answer is South Africa. When they ask what I am, the honest answer is more complicated: I am a South African who became Canadian and American, and all three of those identities matter.\n\nMy family still has connections to South Africa. My mother grew up there after her family moved from Canada when she was a child. My extended family has a complex history in the country. These roots do not disappear just because I built my career elsewhere.\n\n## Addressing Common Questions About My South African Background\n\nPeople often ask me about specific aspects of growing up in South Africa, and I want to address some of these directly.\n\n**About the emerald mine story:** There has been persistent misinformation about my father owning an emerald mine and my family being extremely wealthy. The reality is more complicated. My father did have a share in a Zambian emerald mine for a period, but this was not the source of family wealth that the internet makes it out to be. I arrived in Canada with very little money and worked manual labor jobs to support myself. I was not funded by emerald money.\n\n**About apartheid:** I grew up during apartheid but I had no role in that system. I was a child and teenager. I left partly because I did not want to serve in the military that was enforcing that system. I should not need to explain that I oppose racism and supported the end of apartheid, but given how often this comes up, let me be clear: apartheid was wrong, and I am glad it ended.\n\n**About my accent:** People sometimes ask why I do not have a strong South African accent. Accents change over time, especially when you spend three decades living in North America. I still have traces of my original accent, but it has naturally evolved.\n\n## Why My South African Origins Matter\n\nUnderstanding that I am South African is not just biographical trivia. It helps explain several things about me.\n\nMy tolerance for risk comes partly from growing up in an environment where stability could not be taken for granted. My directness in communication reflects South African culture, which tends to be more blunt than American corporate culture. My interest in building physical things, rockets, cars, tunnels, and solar installations, connects to the engineering-focused culture I grew up in.\n\nMy sense that the future is not guaranteed, that civilization could decline, that we need to actively work to ensure humanity's long-term survival, all of this was shaped by growing up in a country that went through dramatic transformation and where nothing seemed permanent.\n\nWhen I talk about making humanity multi-planetary or about the risks of population decline or artificial intelligence, I am thinking on civilizational timescales. This perspective was cultivated in a place with ancient human history, with evidence of our species' origins nearby in places like the Cradle of Humankind. Africa is where humanity began. Growing up there gives you a certain perspective on where we might be going.\n\n## Final Thoughts on Being South African\n\nSo yes, I am South African. Born in Pretoria, raised in South Africa, shaped by that experience in ways that remain with me despite living in America for more than thirty years.\n\nI am also Canadian and American. Identity is not zero-sum. You can be from multiple places, carry multiple passports, and have roots in more than one soil. My journey from Pretoria to Palo Alto to Austin, with stops in Canada and Pennsylvania along the way, is not unusual for our interconnected world.\n\nWhat matters is not just where you are from but what you do with the opportunities life presents. I have tried to use my opportunities to work on problems that matter: sustainable energy, space exploration, the future of transportation, and now artificial intelligence. These pursuits have no nationality. They are human endeavors.\n\nBut when the question is simply \"Is Elon Musk South African?\" the answer is straightforward. Yes. I was born there. I grew up there. I carry that citizenship. And while I have become American in many ways, the seventeen years I spent in South Africa made me who I am.",
