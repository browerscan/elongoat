  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: We Are Not Fighting, But We Have Disagreements\n\nLet me clear something up immediately. Donald Trump and I are not fighting. We have disagreements on certain policy issues, which is completely normal and healthy in any working relationship. The media loves to dramatize any hint of tension between public figures, but the reality is far more nuanced. I supported Trump's 2024 campaign significantly, and I continue to work with his administration on various initiatives. Having differences of opinion does not constitute a fight.\n\nThat said, there are genuine areas where Trump and I do not see eye to eye. The most significant is the H-1B visa program. I believe skilled immigration is essential for American technological leadership. Trump's base has strong concerns about immigration broadly. We have debated this publicly, and that is fine. I would rather have honest disagreements than pretend to agree on everything.\n\n## The Background: How Trump and I Became Allies\n\nTo understand where we are now, you need to understand how we got here. My relationship with Trump has evolved significantly over the years. During his first term, I served on his economic advisory councils but stepped down in 2017 after he withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement. I believed then, and still believe, that climate change is a serious issue, and pulling out of Paris sent the wrong signal.\n\nFast forward to 2024, and the political landscape had shifted dramatically. I had become increasingly concerned about what I saw as the Democratic Party's drift toward extreme progressivism, censorship, and regulatory overreach. The Biden administration's approach to various issues, including what I perceived as selective enforcement and politically motivated actions, pushed me toward reconsidering my political stance.\n\nI endorsed Trump in July 2024 and committed substantial resources to supporting his campaign through my America PAC. This was not a decision I made lightly. I believed, and still believe, that his economic policies, particularly around deregulation and supporting American manufacturing, align with what the country needs. When he won, I was invited to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, focused on reducing wasteful federal spending.\n\n## The H-1B Visa Controversy Explained\n\nThe most public disagreement between Trump and me centers on the H-1B visa program. Let me explain my position clearly because it has been misrepresented.\n\nAmerica's technological dominance depends on attracting the world's best talent. Full stop. At SpaceX, Tesla, and my other companies, I have seen firsthand how exceptional foreign-born engineers contribute to American innovation. Many of the people working on Starship, on Full Self-Driving, on Neuralink, came to America on H-1B visas. Some have become citizens. They are building the future here, in America, rather than in China or elsewhere.\n\nThe H-1B program has problems. It has been abused by some companies to bring in cheaper labor rather than genuinely exceptional talent. I support reforms that prioritize truly high-skilled individuals and prevent exploitation. But eliminating or severely restricting the program would be catastrophic for American competitiveness.\n\nTrump's base includes many people who are skeptical of any immigration, including skilled immigration. They see H-1B as a threat to American workers. I understand this concern, but I disagree with the conclusion. The best engineers from India, China, and Europe choosing to build their careers in America is a feature, not a bug. It is what makes America exceptional.\n\nWhen I posted about this on X in late December 2024, it sparked a significant backlash from some Trump supporters. Trump himself initially seemed to side with the restrictionists, but he later clarified that he has always supported high-skilled immigration. We had direct conversations about this. We do not agree on every detail, but we are aligned on the need for America to remain globally competitive.\n\n## Other Areas of Disagreement\n\nThe H-1B issue gets the most attention, but there are other areas where Trump and I have different views.\n\n**Electric Vehicles and Climate**: Trump has historically been skeptical of climate change and dismissive of electric vehicles. He has mocked EVs and threatened to roll back EV incentives. This is an area where I have to be pragmatic. Tesla actually does fine without subsidies; our cars sell on their merits. But I do believe the transition to sustainable energy is important for long-term civilizational reasons. Trump and I have discussed this. He is more receptive to the economic and national security arguments for energy independence than to environmental arguments, which is fine. Different people are persuaded by different framings.\n\n**Regulatory Approach**: While we agree on the need for deregulation broadly, we sometimes differ on specifics. I support streamlining regulations that slow down innovation unnecessarily. But some regulations exist for good reasons. The nuance matters, and sometimes Trump's rhetoric about eliminating regulations is more aggressive than what I would advocate.\n\n**Tariffs**: Trump loves tariffs. I am more of a free-trade advocate in principle, though I recognize that tariffs can be useful tools in specific situations, particularly when dealing with countries that do not play fair. China's protectionism in its auto market, for example, is something tariffs can legitimately address. But broad tariffs on allies can backfire.\n\n## Why the Media Exaggerates Our Differences\n\nThe media loves conflict. Elon versus Trump sells clicks. But here is what you need to understand about how news coverage works in 2025.\n\nEvery time I post something on X that slightly differs from Trump's position, articles immediately appear declaring that we are feuding, that the alliance is crumbling, that there is a civil war in the MAGA movement. This is nonsense. It is people trying to generate engagement by manufacturing drama.\n\nTrump and I communicate directly. We do not need to resolve our differences through media intermediaries. When we disagree, we talk about it. That is how functional relationships work. The idea that every policy disagreement represents a fundamental rupture is childish.\n\nI also think some of this coverage reflects wishful thinking from people who opposed Trump's election and are hoping that his coalition will fracture. Sorry to disappoint, but having two strong-willed people disagree on some issues while agreeing on the big picture is not a coalition collapse. It is normal.\n\n## The DOGE Initiative and Our Working Relationship\n\nDespite our disagreements on some issues, Trump and I are collaborating closely on the Department of Government Efficiency. Vivek Ramaswamy and I were initially tasked with identifying opportunities to cut federal spending, and I remain deeply involved in this effort.\n\nThe federal government wastes staggering amounts of money. Hundreds of billions of dollars disappear into bureaucratic inefficiency, duplicate programs, and contracts that benefit connected insiders rather than taxpayers. Fixing this is not a partisan issue. It is basic good governance.\n\nMy experience running companies has taught me that you can often achieve better outcomes with fewer resources if you focus relentlessly on what matters and eliminate what does not. Government does not operate this way because there are no market forces pushing for efficiency. DOGE is an attempt to bring that mindset to federal operations.\n\nTrump has been supportive of these efforts. He understands that cutting waste is both good policy and good politics. We may disagree on immigration policy specifics, but we are aligned on the need for a leaner, more effective federal government.\n\n## My Philosophy on Political Alliances\n\nI want to be clear about something. I am not a Republican partisan. I am not going to agree with everything Trump says or does. I supported Obama initially. I was not involved with politics for many years because I was focused on building companies. My political awakening came from watching institutions I once trusted become captured by ideological agendas that I believe are harmful.\n\nI work with Trump because I believe his administration's policies are better for the country than the alternative. That does not mean I think he is right about everything. I have told him directly when I disagree with him. He respects that. People who are actually strong can handle disagreement. It is insecure people who demand total loyalty and uniformity of opinion.\n\nMy goal is not to be a political figure. My goal is to advance humanity through technology and innovation. But I have learned that politics affects everything. Regulatory environments, tax policy, energy policy, immigration policy, all of these directly impact whether companies like SpaceX and Tesla can succeed in their missions. Pretending politics does not matter is not an option.\n\n## What the Future Holds\n\nTrump and I will continue to disagree on some issues. That is guaranteed. The question is whether we can work together productively on the things we agree about while maintaining honest dialogue about our differences.\n\nI am optimistic that we can. Trump, for all his combativeness with political opponents, has shown that he can work with people who push back on him. He respects strength. I am not going to pretend to agree with him when I do not, and I do not think he would want me to.\n\nThe H-1B debate will continue. I will keep advocating for policies that attract the world's best talent to America. I expect we will find some middle ground that addresses legitimate concerns about visa abuse while preserving America's ability to compete for global talent.\n\nOn EVs and climate, I expect Trump will come to appreciate the economic arguments even if he remains skeptical of environmentalist framing. Tesla is creating American manufacturing jobs. SpaceX is advancing American technological leadership. These are things any president should want to support.\n\n## Addressing the Concern Trolls\n\nThere are people who claim to be concerned about my relationship with Trump but who are actually just opponents of both of us looking for wedge issues. They amplify every disagreement and ignore every area of cooperation.\n\nTo them I say: your concern is noted and dismissed. I did not become the richest person in the world by being easily manipulated. I can distinguish between good-faith criticism and bad-faith concern trolling. I have thick skin and I make my own decisions based on my own analysis, not based on what my critics think I should do.\n\nThe same goes for Trump supporters who get upset when I disagree with Trump. I am not auditioning for a role in the MAGA movement. I am trying to help America maintain its technological and economic leadership. Sometimes that means disagreeing with popular positions. If you expect me to never express disagreement with anything Trump says, you do not understand who I am.\n\n## The Bottom Line: Partners, Not Sycophants\n\nTo summarize: Trump and I are not fighting. We are partners who disagree on some things. This is healthy. A team where everyone agrees on everything is either not thinking hard enough or not being honest.\n\nI will continue to support Trump's administration on initiatives I believe in while being honest about areas where I disagree. I expect the same from him. We have a working relationship built on mutual respect and shared goals, not on performative loyalty.\n\nThe media will continue to manufacture drama. Pundits will continue to analyze every X post for signs of a rift. But the reality is simpler and less interesting than they want it to be: two strong-willed people working together while maintaining their independence. That is not a crisis. That is how things should work.",
