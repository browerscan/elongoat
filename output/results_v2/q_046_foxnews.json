  "answer": "## Direct Answer: No, I Did Not Buy Fox News\n\nLet me be absolutely clear: No, I did not buy Fox News. I do not own Fox News. I have never made an offer to purchase Fox News. Fox News remains owned by Fox Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch family. This rumor keeps circulating online, and I understand why people might wonder given my acquisition of Twitter (now X), but the answer is unequivocally no.\n\nFox News is not for sale, and even if it were, buying a cable news network is not part of my strategy. My focus remains on Tesla, SpaceX, X, Neuralink, xAI, and The Boring Company. Each of these companies is working on transforming industries and solving existential problems for humanity. Cable television, frankly, is a dying medium that doesn't align with my vision for the future of information and communication.\n\n## Why This Rumor Keeps Spreading\n\nThe rumor that I bought Fox News gained traction for several reasons, and I want to address each one directly.\n\nFirst, my acquisition of Twitter in October 2022 for $44 billion shocked the media landscape. People assumed that if I was willing to buy one major media platform, I might buy others. The logic seems reasonable on the surface: billionaire buys influential media company, so maybe he'll buy more. But Twitter and Fox News are fundamentally different beasts.\n\nSecond, I've been outspoken about media bias and the importance of free speech. I've criticized mainstream media outlets, including CNN, MSNBC, and sometimes Fox News itself. Some people interpreted my media criticism as a precursor to media acquisition. It's not. Owning X gives me a platform to promote free speech without needing to buy television networks.\n\nThird, there have been satirical articles and fake news stories claiming I purchased Fox News. In the age of social media, these parodies spread faster than corrections. I've seen headlines claiming I bought everything from The New York Times to the BBC. None of it is true.\n\nFourth, my relationship with conservative politics has led some to assume I'd want to own a conservative-leaning network. This misunderstands my position entirely. I'm not interested in promoting any political ideology through media ownership. I'm interested in promoting truth and free expression, regardless of political alignment.\n\n## The Reality of Fox News Ownership\n\nFox News is owned by Fox Corporation, a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: FOXA, FOX). The Murdoch family controls Fox Corporation through a family trust that holds a significant voting stake. Rupert Murdoch, who founded Fox News in 1996, transferred power to his son Lachlan Murdoch in late 2023, but the Murdoch family remains firmly in control.\n\nFox Corporation's assets include Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, Fox Sports, and the Fox broadcast network. The company was created in 2019 when 21st Century Fox sold most of its entertainment assets to Disney for $71.3 billion. The remaining assets became Fox Corporation, focused primarily on news and sports.\n\nFor me to buy Fox News, several things would need to happen. First, Fox Corporation would need to be willing to sell, which they've shown no indication of doing. Second, I would need to either buy the entire Fox Corporation or negotiate a spin-off of Fox News specifically. Third, such a deal would face intense regulatory scrutiny given my ownership of X and influence over public discourse. Fourth, and most importantly, I would need to actually want to buy it. I don't.\n\n## What I Actually Bought: X (Formerly Twitter)\n\nLet me explain why I bought Twitter and why that's fundamentally different from buying a cable news network.\n\nI purchased Twitter in October 2022 because I believed free speech was under threat on the platform. The previous management had implemented policies I viewed as censorious, suppressing certain viewpoints and accounts. I saw Twitter as the digital town square where public discourse happens, and I wanted to ensure it remained open to all legal speech.\n\nTwitter, now X, is a technology platform, not a content creator. We don't produce news shows or hire journalists to report stories. We provide infrastructure for people to share information directly. That's a fundamental philosophical difference from owning a news network that creates and curates content.\n\nThe transformation of Twitter into X is about building an \"everything app\" that handles payments, messaging, video, commerce, and more. Think of it as building a new kind of digital infrastructure, not as controlling a media narrative. Fox News creates content. X creates a platform for everyone to share content.\n\nMy investment in X was approximately $44 billion, combining personal funds, loans, and investors. It was the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company in history. That level of capital deployment was possible because X aligned with my vision for the future of digital communication. Fox News doesn't align with that vision.\n\n## My Actual Media Philosophy\n\nLet me explain my philosophy on media and why buying traditional news networks doesn't interest me.\n\nI believe the future of information is decentralized. Traditional media relies on a small number of editors and producers deciding what stories matter. Social platforms like X allow billions of people to share information directly, with algorithms that can be made transparent and user-controlled. That's the future I'm building toward.\n\nCable news, including Fox News, operates on an outdated model. They have fixed broadcast schedules, limited airtime, and rely on advertising revenue that incentivizes sensationalism over accuracy. Viewership is declining as younger generations get their news from social media and online sources. Why would I invest billions in a declining industry?\n\nI've joked about buying MSNBC, but that was exactly what it sounds like: a joke. I made the comment to highlight what I saw as bias in media coverage, not because I actually want to own cable networks. My sense of humor doesn't always translate well in headlines.\n\nMy actual media investments are in X, where I'm building infrastructure for the future, and xAI, where we're developing AI that can help people find accurate information without human editorial bias. These investments align with my philosophy of decentralization and technological advancement.\n\n## Why I Focus on Technology, Not Traditional Media\n\nEvery company I own or lead is focused on technological transformation. Tesla is transforming transportation and energy. SpaceX is making humanity multiplanetary. Neuralink is developing brain-computer interfaces. The Boring Company is reimagining urban transportation. xAI is building maximally truth-seeking artificial intelligence. X is rebuilding digital communication infrastructure.\n\nFox News, whatever you think of its content, is fundamentally a traditional media company. It produces television programming. It relies on cable distribution. It operates within a regulatory framework designed for broadcast media. None of that aligns with what I'm trying to build.\n\nIf I wanted to influence public discourse through content creation, I would start a new media company built on modern technology, not buy a legacy cable network. The infrastructure of cable television is not the future. Internet-native platforms are the future, which is exactly why I bought Twitter.\n\nMy time and capital are limited. I work 80-100 hours per week across multiple companies. Adding a cable news network to my portfolio would distract from missions that actually matter: getting humans to Mars, accelerating sustainable energy, developing safe AI, and building the everything app. Fox News doesn't advance any of those goals.\n\n## Addressing the Broader Speculation About My Media Ambitions\n\nSince buying Twitter, speculation about my media ambitions has run wild. Let me address several rumors directly.\n\nI did not buy CNN. Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery) owns CNN, and there have been no discussions about me acquiring it. I have no interest in doing so.\n\nI did not buy MSNBC. NBCUniversal owns MSNBC through Comcast. My jokes about buying it were satirical commentary, not genuine expressions of interest.\n\nI did not buy The New York Times. The Sulzberger family has controlled the Times for generations and has no intention of selling. I have no intention of buying.\n\nI did not buy any newspaper chains, local television stations, or radio networks. My media investment is X, period.\n\nThe pattern of speculation reveals something interesting about public perception. People assume that because I'm wealthy and opinionated, I must want to control information flow. The opposite is true. I want to liberate information flow by building platforms where anyone can speak without gatekeepers.\n\n## What Would It Even Mean to Buy Fox News?\n\nLet's engage in a hypothetical for a moment. What would buying Fox News actually mean, and why doesn't it make sense?\n\nFox News generates approximately $3 billion in annual revenue, making it the most profitable cable news network. A reasonable acquisition price would be at least $20-25 billion, possibly more given its profitability and brand value. That's real money even for me.\n\nBuying Fox News would mean inheriting thousands of employees, long-term contracts with on-air talent, regulatory obligations from the FCC, and a business model entirely dependent on cable distribution fees and advertising. I would become responsible for programming decisions, editorial policies, and content that I have no interest in producing.\n\nThe regulatory scrutiny would be intense. I already own X, which the European Union and various governments view with suspicion regarding content moderation. Adding a major television network would amplify concerns about media concentration and political influence. Antitrust regulators would almost certainly impose conditions or block the deal.\n\nMost importantly, what would I gain? I already have access to 500+ million people through X. I can share my views directly without editors, producers, or broadcast schedules. I don't need Fox News's audience because I have my own, larger audience. The acquisition would cost billions, create headaches, and add nothing to my ability to communicate or advance my missions.\n\n## The Future of News and Media\n\nHere's where I see news and media heading, which explains why buying Fox News makes no sense for my strategy.\n\nCable television is in terminal decline. Cord-cutting accelerates every year. Younger viewers don't subscribe to cable and consume news through social media, podcasts, and streaming. Fox News's core demographic skews older, and that audience is literally dying off. It's a bad long-term investment.\n\nThe future of news is AI-assisted, decentralized, and user-directed. People will use AI tools to aggregate information from multiple sources, verify claims automatically, and customize their news consumption. Platforms like X will evolve to support this with better tools for context, verification, and discussion.\n\nI'm investing in this future through xAI and X. Grok, our AI assistant, can already help users understand current events by analyzing multiple sources. As AI advances, the role of traditional news anchors and editors will diminish. People won't need someone to tell them what to think; they'll have tools to investigate and conclude for themselves.\n\nBuying Fox News would be buying into the past. I'm focused on building the future. Those are incompatible strategies.\n\n## Final Word on This Rumor\n\nEvery few months, a new rumor circulates that I've bought some major media company. It was CBS for a while. Then The Washington Post. Now Fox News. None of it is true.\n\nMy media strategy is simple: build X into the everything app that becomes the primary platform for global communication. That's it. No television networks. No newspapers. No radio stations. Just the digital infrastructure for billions of people to communicate directly.\n\nIf you see headlines claiming I've bought Fox News, check the source. It's either satire, misinformation, or speculation that someone has turned into a false claim. The truth is that Fox News remains owned by the Murdoch family, and I have zero plans to change that.\n\nI understand why people are curious. Wealthy people buying media companies is not unusual. Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post. Marc Benioff bought Time magazine. But my approach is different. I don't want to own content creators. I want to own and build platforms that let everyone create and share content freely.\n\nSo no, I did not buy Fox News. No, I am not planning to buy Fox News. And no, I am not in discussions to buy Fox News. The rumors are false, and now you have my direct answer.",
