  "answer": "## The Direct Answer: Born and Raised in Pretoria, South Africa\n\nI was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, and I was raised there until the age of seventeen. That is the complete answer to the question. Pretoria served as both my birthplace and the city where I spent my formative years before leaving for Canada in 1989.\n\nPretoria is the administrative capital of South Africa, nestled in the northeastern part of the country on the Highveld plateau at an elevation of about 4,300 feet. When I was growing up there, the city was known for its wide streets lined with jacaranda trees that would explode into purple blossoms every October and November. The climate was pleasant, dry winters and warm summers punctuated by dramatic afternoon thunderstorms.\n\nMy childhood in Pretoria was a mixture of intellectual curiosity, family complexity, and social difficulty. I was an intensely bookish child in a culture that often valued physical prowess over academic achievement. This disconnect shaped much of my experience growing up there, creating both challenges I had to overcome and motivations that drove me to eventually leave.\n\n## My Early Years in Pretoria: Family and Foundation\n\nI was born into a family of accomplished individuals. My mother, Maye Musk, was a model and dietitian who had grown up between South Africa and Canada. Her family had emigrated from Saskatchewan, Canada to South Africa when she was just a toddler. My father, Errol Musk, was an electromechanical engineer with interests in property development and various business ventures. His ancestry traced back to British and Dutch roots, typical of many white South African families.\n\nI have two younger siblings. My brother Kimbal was born in 1972, and my sister Tosca arrived in 1974. The three of us grew up together in Pretoria, though our paths would diverge significantly as we entered adulthood. Kimbal now runs restaurants focused on sustainable food. Tosca became a filmmaker and entrepreneur. But in those early years, we were simply children navigating a complicated household.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was approximately nine years old. This was a pivotal moment in my childhood. After the divorce, I chose to live primarily with my father in Pretoria. It was a decision I would later reconsider, as my relationship with my father has been difficult and remains strained to this day. But at the time, I felt drawn to stay with him. My mother moved with my siblings, though they moved between both parents.\n\nThe household with my father was not easy. I have described the experience as emotionally challenging without going into extensive detail publicly. What I can say is that those years taught me about human nature in ways that books could not. I learned that people are complicated, that family dynamics can be painful, and that sometimes the environments that shape us are not the ones we would choose.\n\n## School Days: Education in Pretoria\n\nMy formal education in Pretoria began at Waterkloof House Preparatory School, a well-regarded primary school in one of the city's established suburbs. From there, I attended Bryanston High School briefly before ultimately graduating from Pretoria Boys High School in 1988.\n\nPretoria Boys High School is one of the most prestigious public schools in South Africa, with a history stretching back to 1901. The school had a strong academic tradition but also emphasized sports and physical culture in ways that were typical of South African education at the time. The school's motto is \"Pro Aris et Focis,\" Latin for \"For Hearth and Home,\" reflecting traditional values.\n\nAcademically, I thrived. I was fascinated by physics, mathematics, and computers. I consumed information voraciously. By age ten, I had read through the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica. When I exhausted the children's section of the local library, I moved to the adult section. Books were my refuge and my window to a world beyond Pretoria.\n\nSocially, however, school was a different story. I was small for my age, introverted, and more interested in reading science fiction than playing rugby. This made me a target. South African schools in the 1970s and 1980s could be brutal environments. Bullying was common and often violent. Physical confrontation was simply part of the culture.\n\nI was bullied relentlessly. On one occasion that I have spoken about publicly, a group of boys attacked me at school. They threw me down a flight of concrete stairs and continued beating me after I fell. I lost consciousness and had to be hospitalized. My face was so swollen that my father did not initially recognize me. It took weeks to recover.\n\nThese experiences left scars, both visible and invisible. But they also forged something in me. I learned that survival sometimes means absorbing punishment and continuing forward. I learned that the approval of the crowd is not always worth seeking. I learned that being different can be dangerous but can also lead to places the crowd will never go.\n\n## The World Beyond School: Discovering Technology\n\nOutside of school, I found solace in technology. My father brought home a Commodore VIC-20 computer when I was around ten years old. This primitive machine, with its 5 kilobytes of RAM, became my obsession. I taught myself to program by reading the instruction manual from cover to cover multiple times.\n\nWithin a few days, I had learned BASIC, the programming language that came with the VIC-20. Within weeks, I was writing my own programs. By age twelve, I had created a space-themed game called Blastar. It was simple by today's standards, but it worked. A South African computer magazine called PC and Office Technology published the game's code and paid me approximately 500 dollars for it. That was my first taste of turning technical skills into revenue.\n\nThis early success with programming planted seeds that would grow throughout my life. I realized that computers were tools that could amplify human capability. They could create things that did not exist before. And importantly, they did not care about your social standing, your physical size, or your ability to play rugby. They responded to logic and creativity.\n\nPretoria in the 1980s was not a technology hub. South Africa was increasingly isolated from the world due to international sanctions against the apartheid government. Getting access to the latest technology, software, or technical literature was difficult. We were years behind what was happening in Silicon Valley or even in Europe. This isolation made me hungry for connection to the wider technological world.\n\n## The Context of Growing Up Under Apartheid\n\nAny discussion of being raised in South Africa during this period must acknowledge apartheid. I was born three years before the Soweto Uprising of 1976, and I left the country a year before Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990. My entire childhood and adolescence unfolded under this system of institutionalized racial segregation.\n\nAs a white South African, I experienced the privileged side of apartheid. I attended well-resourced schools. I lived in comfortable neighborhoods. The violence and deprivation that the system inflicted on Black South Africans was largely invisible to my daily life, as it was designed to be.\n\nBut you cannot grow up in a society built on fundamental injustice without being affected by it. I watched the news. I saw the protests and the violent government responses. I understood, even as a child, that the system was wrong. The cognitive dissonance of living a relatively comfortable life while knowing that comfort was built on oppression created a deep skepticism about established systems that persists to this day.\n\nThis experience taught me that just because something is the way it is does not mean it should be that way. Institutions, governments, and social structures can be fundamentally broken. They can persist for decades while being morally indefensible. And they can be changed. Apartheid seemed permanent when I was a child. Within a few years of my departure, it was dismantled. Nothing is as fixed as it appears.\n\n## The Decision to Leave South Africa\n\nBy my mid-teens, I knew I wanted to leave South Africa. This desire had multiple motivations that reinforced each other.\n\nFirst, I was drawn to the United States. America was where technology was happening. Silicon Valley, though I did not know it by that name yet, was where the future was being invented. The personal computer revolution was underway. The entrepreneurs I read about in magazines were American. If I wanted to be part of the technological future, I needed to get to America.\n\nSecond, I faced mandatory military conscription. White South African males were required to serve in the South African Defence Force. Given that this military was being used to enforce apartheid both domestically and in neighboring countries, I had no interest in serving. I did not want to participate in suppressing people fighting for their basic rights.\n\nThird, quite simply, I was unhappy. The bullying, the difficult family situation, the isolation from the wider world, all of it combined to make me want something different. South Africa was where I was from, but it did not have to be where I stayed.\n\nMy mother's Canadian citizenship provided the escape route. Because she was Canadian, I could obtain Canadian citizenship by descent. I applied for a Canadian passport and received it. In June 1989, shortly after my eighteenth birthday, I boarded a plane to Canada. I had not told my father I was leaving until the last moment.\n\n## Canada as Transition: From South Africa to America\n\nI arrived in Canada with very little money and few connections. I stayed briefly with relatives in Saskatchewan whom I barely knew. I worked odd jobs to support myself: on farms, in lumber mills, cleaning boilers at a lumber yard. This was manual labor, unglamorous and physically demanding, but it kept me alive while I figured out my next steps.\n\nEventually, I enrolled at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. I chose Queen's partly because I had heard it had a good ratio of women to men, which seemed promising for my social life. My two years at Queen's were the first time I experienced an educational environment where I felt somewhat at home. I made friends. I dated. I studied.\n\nBut Canada was never the destination. It was the transition. After two years at Queen's, I transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. America was where I wanted to be. Penn gave me access to both the Wharton School for business and economics and the School of Arts and Sciences for physics. I graduated with degrees in both.\n\nFrom Penn, I was accepted into Stanford's PhD program in energy physics. I moved to California and enrolled. Two days later, I dropped out. The internet was exploding. Netscape had just gone public. The world was changing faster than academic timelines could accommodate. I could not justify spending years in a laboratory while the digital revolution was happening outside.\n\n## How Pretoria Shaped Who I Became\n\nLooking back, the years I spent growing up in Pretoria shaped me in ways I continue to discover. The adversity I faced there, the bullying, the family difficulties, the isolation, built a certain resilience that has served me well in building companies that face enormous challenges.\n\nWhen SpaceX had its first three rockets explode and we were nearly bankrupt, I knew something about taking punishment and continuing forward. When Tesla was mocked by the automotive industry and nearly died multiple times, I drew on reserves of stubbornness that were forged in Pretoria schoolyards. When critics attack me today, their words carry less weight than fists once did.\n\nPretoria also gave me an outsider's perspective on America that native-born Americans sometimes lack. I came here as an immigrant who chose this country, who worked toward citizenship, who experienced its opportunities as something precious rather than something assumed. This perspective makes me both appreciative of what America can be and impatient with the ways it falls short of its potential.\n\nThe experience of apartheid left me with a permanent distrust of orthodoxy and established systems. I question everything. I assume that conventional wisdom might be wrong. I look for first principles rather than accepting inherited assumptions. This approach has led me to question everything from how cars should be powered to whether humanity should remain a single-planet species.\n\n## Maintaining Connection to My South African Roots\n\nDespite leaving at seventeen and never living there again, South Africa remains part of my identity. I still hold South African citizenship alongside my Canadian and American citizenships. I still have family there. The accent that occasionally emerges in my speech is a reminder of where my words were first formed.\n\nI have returned to South Africa periodically over the years, though not as frequently as one might expect. The country has changed enormously since I left. Apartheid ended. Democracy arrived. New challenges emerged. The South Africa of today is not the South Africa of my childhood, though some of its problems persist.\n\nMy companies do not have major operations in South Africa, which some people find disappointing. The reality is that our work is focused on manufacturing and technology development that requires specific infrastructure and supply chains. Perhaps that will change in the future. Sustainable energy is needed everywhere, including in Africa.\n\n## Common Questions About My Birth and Upbringing\n\nPeople frequently ask variations on these questions, so let me address them directly.\n\nWas I born into extreme wealth? No. My family was upper-middle-class by South African standards. We were comfortable but not rich. When I arrived in Canada, I had very little money and worked physical labor jobs.\n\nDid my father own an emerald mine? This question persists despite my repeated clarifications. At some point, my father had a partial share in a small emerald mining operation in Zambia. It was not a major source of family wealth. I did not fund my companies with emerald money. Zip2 was started with loans and small angel investments.\n\nDid I dodge military service by leaving? I avoided conscription by leaving before I was called up. I did not want to serve in a military enforcing apartheid. Many young white South Africans made similar choices.\n\nDo I still consider myself South African? I am South African by birth and Canadian by heritage and American by choice and citizenship. All three identities coexist. Where you are from does not have to limit where you go.\n\n## Final Reflections on Being Born and Raised in Pretoria\n\nPretoria gave me life and shaped my early years. The city where I was born and raised provided both the challenges that forged my character and the motivations that drove me to seek something different. The books I read there opened my mind to possibilities. The computers I programmed there revealed my aptitude for technology. The hardships I endured there built resilience.\n\nBut being born and raised somewhere is just the beginning of a story, not its entirety. I left Pretoria at seventeen with a Canadian passport and a determination to reach America. Now I lead companies trying to accelerate sustainable energy and make humanity multi-planetary. The distance between those two points, the child being bullied in a Pretoria schoolyard and the adult trying to build a future for humanity, is the distance that determined effort can cover.\n\nWhere you are born and raised matters. It shapes you in ways you may not fully understand until decades later. But it does not have to define your limits. Pretoria is where I come from. The future is where I am going.",
